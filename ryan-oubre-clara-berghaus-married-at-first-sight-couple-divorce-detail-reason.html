However, Ryan began having doubts about whether Clara could handle having an interracial child. He felt that her conduct wasn't a reflection of someone that respected people of color and that wasn't how he wanted his children to be raised.</p><p>Ryan stated, “By marrying into a different race/culture you inherently adopt parts of their identity. Most importantly, your kids 100 percent will, and your kids will need you to help navigate it. They’ll need you to help teach, train, and understand as best you can – a systematically racist system. Choosing not to attempt to understand and educate yourself is a red flag.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Married at First Sight’s Clara Berghaus Celebrates Signing Divorce Papers After Ryan Oubre Split</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipspmeYry2rtGeZJykkaeubq7Eq56hmaWoeq6t0augnpxdlsFussirqq1lo560qcCMnKauqJyaeqW11aipnJ1dmbK1rcilZKudkai8r3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
