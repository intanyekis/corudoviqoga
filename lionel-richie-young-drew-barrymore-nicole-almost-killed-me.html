I don’t even know how I’m going to take that backstage.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Never Been Kissed</a> actress proceeded to tell the audience that she’s known Lionel’s oldest daughter, Nicole, 41, <a href=#>“for years” after growing up in Hollywood</a>. (Nicole was adopted by Lionel and his ex-wife <strong>Brenda Harvey</strong>&nbsp;when she was 9 years old. The “Dancing on the Ceiling” musician also shares son <strong>Miles</strong>, 28, and daughter <a href=#><strong>Sofia</strong></a>, 24, with ex-wife <strong>Diane Alexander</strong>.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lionel-Richie-Tells-Drew-Barrymore-Her-Wild-Days-With-Daughter-Nicole-Richie-Almost-Killed-Me-2.jpg><p>“We’re part of this little girl wolf pack,” Barrymore explained on Thursday. “I think Nicole and I have figured out how to have so much fun and then pull it together and be really good moms.”</p><p>Lionel quipped: “I don’t even know how that happened. As parents you go, ‘This is going to be a disaster.’ Because Nicole and <a href=#><strong>Paris [Hilton]</strong></a>, let’s talk about it, <a href=#>when they started out [were insane]</a>.” In the early 2000s, the Simple Life costars made headlines for their wild ways, including <a href=#>Nicole’s stint in rehab and her 2006 DUI</a>.</p><p>The “Hello” crooner revealed on the talk show, “If I can live through that, I can live through anything. Then it became this committee. I call them the bitty committee.”</p><p>The <a href=#>American Idol</a> judge confessed he thought there was “no way” Nicole’s crew, including Hilton, 42, and Barrymore could “transcend into a family with husbands and kids.” But now, he admitted, “It turned out perfect.”</p><p>Nicole became a mom in January 2008, <a href=#>welcoming daughter Harlow</a> with <a href=#><strong>Joel Madden</strong></a>. The couple, who tied the knot in December 2010, welcomed their son, Sparrow, in September 2009.</p><p>Barrymore, meanwhile, welcomed <a href=#>daughters Olive and Frankie</a> in September 2012 and April 2014, respectively, with now ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Will Kopelman</strong></a>. The pair split in 2016 after four years of marriage. Hilton, for her part, welcomed her first child, <a href=#>son Phoenix</a>, in January after <a href=#>marrying <strong>Carter Reum</strong> in November 2021</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lionel-Richie-Tells-Drew-Barrymore-Her-Wild-Days-With-Daughter-Nicole-Richie-Almost-Killed-Me-3.jpg><p>The Charlie’s Angels actress — <a href=#>who went to rehab at age 13</a> and revealed in March that <a href=#>she hasn’t “had a drink in almost four years”</a> — agreed with Lionel. “We turned out OK,” Barrymore said on Thursday, revealing, “We got it all out of our systems.”</p><p>Lionel, however, remembered the girls’ childhoods as a little more than just teenage fun.</p><p>“Let me give you my side of the story. You all almost killed me. I’m so glad you got it out of your system,” the “All Night Long” singer said. “I almost lost consciousness. Some nights I would get a phone call [from the sheriff saying], ‘We have Nicole here.’ [I’d say], ‘What did she do now?’ [And they replied], ‘She went down the wrong way of the freeway.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The <a href=#>Grammy winner</a> laughed, asking Barrymore, “Who is going to pay me back for all that medication I took?”</p><p>Lionel joked that the only way he made it through those crazy years was that he was “somewhere between meditation and medication.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaloZ%2Bjsq150aKaoaGVYsawwc2gZJ2qlax6o63Rq7Cmp6Kaeq%2B1wqijnmWRobqwv9NmoqKknJqxbrnEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
