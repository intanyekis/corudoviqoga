The pair got the internet talking when they announced their impending divorce in October 2022 after 13 years of marriage and two children, Benjamin Rein and Vivian Lake, together.</p><p><a href=#>How the divorce affected Tom Brady’s net worth</a> and the dynamics of splitting the family have been discussed.

That — and the kids — was what people were wondering about. How would they amicably part ways with the combined massive fortune they have built for over a decade?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/gisele-bundchen-and-tom-brady.jpg><p>Ultimately, that did not need pondering between the couple because they were protected. <strong>Gisele Bündchen</strong><strong>and Tom Brady had an ironclad prenup that protected their respective fortunes.</strong></p><p>The couple was prepared and had lawyers in place to settle issues outside their prenup through a mediator before revealing their separation.</p><p>This in no way affected their separate earnings, with Gisele Bündchen worth $400 million and Tom Brady worth about $333 million. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gisele and Tom's combined over $700 million was split</a> according to the earning potential of the former couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"There was an ironclad prenup set down before they married in 2009. They both have their own separate business entities, so the separation of their wealth wasn’t that complicated in the end. The only other major factor was dividing up their massive property portfolio," a source close to Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady once told Page Six.</p><p>For joint assets, the couple shared a $26 million real estate portfolio, with homes in Miami, Montana, and New York in the United States and one vacation home in Costa Rica. Page Six also reported that Bündchen kept the family's home in Costa Rica. She also kept the NYC apartment, but no word on what happened to their home at the Yellowstone Club in Montana.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/How-Tom-Brady--Gisele-Bundchen-Parent-Their-Children.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Real Reason Tom Brady And Gisele Bündchen's Potential Divorce Settlement Might Get Very Messy</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Despite the fact that Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen have a prenup in place, there are a lot of unanswered settlement questions.</span><p>Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady’s divorce settlement was also the easiest, with the couple revising their prenup months before their actual divorce.
