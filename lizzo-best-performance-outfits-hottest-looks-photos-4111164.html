Take her appearance at the 2022 BET Awards. She shut things down wearing a glittering gold look during her performance of “About Damn Time”. Talk about star power!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lizzo-hottest-performance-looks-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Likewise, Lizzo went for full diva style during her emotional performance of “Jerome” at the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>American Music Awards</a> on November 24, 2020. Not only did she belt out the ballad with everything she had, her maroon tulle dress perfectly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>complimented her figure</a>, showing off one of Lizzo’s legs with a slit! It was just the right choice for the stunning performance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lizzo-gorgeous-performance-looks-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Lizzo has also been known to get fun and flirty with her looks and live renditions of her songs on stage! During the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>40th Annual Brit Awards</a> on February 18, Lizzo appeared in draped fabric at the top of a staircase before she revealed her checkered leotard underneath. The singer totally danced it out in her look, and carried with her a fierceness that was completely unmatched by any other nominee!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Then, there’s the pièce de résistance of all of Lizzo’s on-stage attire. At the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2019 BET Awards</a> on June 23, 2019, Lizzo went all out by wearing a sexy bridal number during her performance of “Truth Hurts.” Standing atop a set of stairs, Lizzo removed her veil, and the skirt of her dress to reveal this hot bustier leotard with jewels dripping from her necklace! Her look, like her performance, was totally pitch perfect!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lizzo-gorgeous-performance-looks-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>But there are so many more looks beyond these that Lizzo has served on stage at various industry events!
