I’m in the second trimester, so [I’m] feeling better, getting a little more energy back,” Martin, 38, exclusively told Us Weekly at BravoCon on Saturday, November 4. “The days are long here, but the fans give me all the energy that I need.”</p><p>Martin took to social media on Thursday, November 2, to announce that she was pregnant with her and fiancé <strong>Anthony Lopez’s</strong> second child. (The couple also share son Greyson, 4.)</p><p>“Extra! Extra! Our family is growing ❤️,” she wrote alongside a <a href=# rel=noopener>video of her and Lopez</a>, 42, holding newspapers that said, “Baby Lopez Coming Soon!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RHOM-s-Dr.-Nicole-Martin-is-Feeling-Good-After-Announcing-Her-2nd-Pregnancy-With-Anthony-Lopez-275.jpg><p>The Bravo star shared that Greyson was “so excited” when he found out that he was going to be a big brother.</p><p>“He’s the one that was really like, ‘Can I have a baby sister?’ He was very adamant and specific that he wanted a baby sister,” Martin explained to Us, adding that Greyson “wouldn’t have to share his toys if it was a girl.”</p><p>Martin has been dating Lopez since 2015, and the twosome welcomed Greyson in February 2019.</p><p>“Greyson, love you more than I ever thought possible! From your nose to your toes but especially those lips 😍Welcome to the world baby boy,” Martin wrote via Instagram at the time alongside a picture of the then-newborn.</p><p>Two years later, Lopez popped the question to the anesthesiologist in December 2021.</p><p>“Creating a life we love… Always ❤️,” Martin captioned a photo of the pair in bed.</p><p>In a March 2022 Real Housewives of Miami episode, Martin explained her reasoning behind waiting to get married to Lopez.</p><p>“It was never about being pro- or anti-marriage. It was really about just being happy no matter what,” she shared during the <a href=#>season 4</a> RHOM reunion episode. “I was happy before he asked. We had a great relationship before he asked. And I’m happy and we have a great relationship after he asked. And if he would have never asked? I would have still stayed with him and been happy.”</p><p>Martin — a board-certified anesthesiologist —<a href=#> joined RHOM in season 4</a>, which aired in December 2021. During her first season, Martin sparked some drama with RHOM costar <strong>Marysol Patton</strong> after she accused the doctor of trash-talking other women behind their backs.</p><p>“I heard about three different occasions of the same kind of commentary, from different people,” Patton, 56, told <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Tonight </a>in February 2022, explaining that she decided to confront Martin on-camera over the rumors. Martin later called the moment a “bullying attack.” However, Martin felt a lot more confident going into season 5.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“My first season was just such a foreign world to me in so many ways. I didn’t really know a lot of the women well, so the connection wasn’t a strong one,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener>Vulture</a> in March. “Maybe I was a bit standoffish, or it was hard to just be natural when there were all these cameras and mics and stuff around. For the second season, the relationships were more involved. I think there’s definitely a comfort factor there that allows you to be more natural. You can be more authentic, less censored.”</p><p>Reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGanoZOkuaZ5zJqpraGeYra0ecWenKWhnpx6qLvOnWSanqSav2680Z6ep5memMZurc2npq6mk5q6prrTaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
