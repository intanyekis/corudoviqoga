Alison Sweeney has been a Hallmark Channel staple since 2013’s Second Chances — but her role as a wife and mother dates back to 2000.
The Murder, She Baked star and husband David Sanov tied the knot in 2000 after knowing each other most of their lives.
“The way we know each other is that his dad and my mom are both violinists. They both performed at our wedding together,” Sweeney told Entertainment Tonight in November 2020."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They both performed at our wedding together,” Sweeney told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in November 2020. “It was such a special moment then. Those two violins are how Dave and I met. We have two beautiful children and we have been married 20 years. It was such a special day.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Hannah Swensen Mysteries actress</a> revealed in November 2022 that her strong relationship with Sanov has made her career highs that much better.</p><p>“We came into the marriage really honest with each other about what we wanted from life and who we were as people,” Sweeney told <a href=#>Fox News</a> at the time. “And even though we were both really young, we sort of grew up together, and grew together, and learned together, and have always been respectful of each other and our differences.”</p><p>The couple’s bond has only grown since <a href=#>welcoming their two children</a>: Benjamin and Megan in 2005 and 2009, respectively.</p><p>“I’m so grateful on Mother’s Day for my incredible family. My handsome hubby and beautiful kids have made this such a special day,” the Days of Our Lives actress <a href=#>wrote via Instagram</a> in May 2018. “To all you moms out there I send you my love today! #mothersday #family #Sunday.”</p><p>One year later, <a href=#>the former Biggest Loser host</a> gushed about her loved ones and how blessed she is to be a mom.</p><p>“I think the most rewarding part is watching your kids flourish and find the things that they’re good at and celebrate that and encourage that,” Sweeney told <a href=#>Closer Weekly</a> in August 2019. “They’re just great kids. I’m so lucky.”</p><p>The family’s love for one another is even more evident during the holidays, according to the A Magical Christmas Village actress.</p><p>“We do sort of the traditional traditions. Decorating the tree together,” the California native <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly in October 2022</a>. “I love the stockings … pulling stockings out and they’re hung by the chimney with care. And we watch a bunch of Christmas movies at Christmas time.”</p><p>Sweeney revealed that she considers Die Hard “<a href=#>to be a Christmas movie</a>,” so that film is on the docket every year. She added that <a href=#>A Christmas Story</a> and <a href=#>Home Alone</a> are on the group’s must-watch list as well.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I love the idea of Christmas magic,” the Wedding Veil trilogy star teased. “I do believe in Christmas magic, for sure.
