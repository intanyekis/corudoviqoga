 Kelce had tests done on his knee immediately after practice Tuesday, and those tests revealed the inflammation but no tears, the source said. More tests are expected to be done Wednesday morning. Jason Kelce, Travis’ older brother and a Philadelphia Eagles center, told 94WIP’s “Morning Show” on Wednesday that Travis has a bone bruise and swelling in his knee."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Last season, Gray, in 17 games, produced 28 receptions for 299 yards, including two touchdowns. The other serviceable tight end on the Chiefs’ 53-man initial roster is <a class=ath_autolink data-id=MayR4Pa0CBLnUZ7J href=#>Blake Bell</a>, who is known for his strong blocking ability.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Perhaps a more viable option is that the Chiefs use all seven of their receivers that earned an initial roster spot, a first since Andy Reid became the team’s coach in 2013. The Chiefs are optimistic that they know the main role of their top three receivers. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=BSKlIouLvUAvaGy7 href=#>Kadarius Toney</a>, the dynamic three-year player who missed training camp and the preseason after recovering from surgery to repair meniscus and cartilage in his knee, is the Chiefs’ projected No. 1 receiver — a player capable of creating highlights no matter where on the field when he touches the ball.</p><p><a class=ath_autolink data-id=QZu3f1NNn1Im0ne7 href=#>Marquez Valdes-Scantling</a>, a six-year veteran, will resume his role as the Chiefs’ best deep-threat option. And <a class=ath_autolink data-id=H0UViqmc1cfNpilj href=#>Skyy Moore</a> is expected to be tasked with winning certain matchups in the middle of the field as the slot receiver. — Taylor</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>What Travis Kelce’s absence would mean for the Chiefs on Thursday night</p></a><h2>How carefully should Kansas City tread with his injury?</h2><p>Because the injury happened Tuesday, the Chiefs will have just 48 hours to determine if <a href=#>Kelce</a>, an 11-year veteran at age 33, can be available and effective to help his teammates. If <a href=#>Kelce</a> is inactive Thursday night, it will be the first time he has missed a game because of injury since he became a starter in 2014. Such an absence would mean that the Chiefs would play against the Lions without two of their three best players: Kelce and superstar defensive tackle <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Ckbq2u8Ohir009QP href=#>Chris Jones</a>, who is holding out for a lucrative contract extension.</p><p>The Chiefs, though, should be cautious with Kelce because the team will have 10 days to rest his knee before its Week 2 game against the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=45 href=#>Jacksonville Jaguars</a>. — Taylor</p><h2>Backstory</h2><p>Kelce earned Pro Bowl honors for the eighth time last season as he put up 110 receptions for 1,338 yards and 12 touchdowns.</p><p>The 2013 third-round draft pick has 814 receptions for 10,344 yards and 69 touchdowns in his career.</p><h2>Required reading</h2><p>(Photo: Jay Biggerstaff / USA Today)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k3Fqb2tgaHxzfJFsZmlxX2WCcMDRmq2iq12gsq2vxGaip52VYravttSrsGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
