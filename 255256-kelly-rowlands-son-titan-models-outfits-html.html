Both shots were taken outdoors, with the greenery contrasting with what the cute boy had on.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>The last picture in the slideshow captured Titan wearing a more colorful piece from Queen Bee's fabulous collection as he lounged high up on a shelf.

Titan is one of the few children to have modeled Beyonce's limited-edition Icy Park line.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Prior to its launch in February, the line <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/style/beyonce-adidas-ivy-park-icy-launch/>had already gone viral</a> because top celebrities and their kids were modeling it.

The two also share another son named Noah. They welcomed him earlier this year, and the proud mother made the announcement via social media.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>She shared a photo of the baby and his older brother, who was looking down at him with a smile on his face. The same shot <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/style/beyonce-adidas-ivy-park-icy-launch/>was also shared</a> on Titan's Instagram page. The boy was happy to meet his new brother, but he wasn't the only one.</p>Read also<a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>Beyoncé's Half-Brother, 13, Raised in Trailer By Single Mom For Years, Has Still Had 'No Contact' With Singer</h2></a><a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>Beyoncé Captured with Rarely-Seen Twin Daughter, 6, Born after Miscarriages, Hard Pregnancy & Labor</h2></a><a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>Gena Rowlands Stuns in Leopard Print Dress: She Is ‘Lady’ at 93 after Raising 3 Kids Following Husband’s Death</h2></a><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Beyonce and Rowland grew up singing together in the same band and even after the group disbanded, the two women maintained their bond and stayed relevant to each other.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Therefore, it is hardly surprising that the music icon was especially happy when <a class="ae -U" href=#>Rowland</a> announced her new child's birth.
