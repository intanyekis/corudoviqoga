How about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a personal zoo of over 500 exotic animals</a>?&nbsp;Belhasa’s home is rumored to be one of the most expensive in all the land and allows him the space to nurture tigers, lions, giraffes, zebras, cheetahs, and chimps.&nbsp;It is here where he keeps himself and his high profile friends entertained. One such name - Paris Hilton.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's not the name of one of his celebrity friends. That's the name of his monkey. Honest.</p><h2 id=the-kicks>The Kicks</h2><p>All those animals keep him on his toes and, because of that, he has a one <a href=#>million dollar sneaker collection</a> to also keep on those toes. He houses this massive wardrobe of footwear in a giant room with specialty cabinets that keep them all ordered and in good condition. With literally thousands to chose from in his "sneaker wardrobe", it's nothing for him to wear a new pair every day.</p><h2 id=the-cars>The Cars</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, the most obvious purchase that a teenager with all the money of Richie Rich would make would be ones that drive fast. Money Kicks kicks his money towards a bevy of cars that would make even Jay Leno blush. The heir proudly owns a Ferrari F12 Berlinetta adorned in a red Supreme x Louis Vuitton print. At the time of its purchase in 2017, he wasn't even of age yet to drive it. Add to that his Yeezy-inspired Cadillac Escalade with white and black print that is said to be worth in excess of $100,000, a Rolls-Royce Wraith, and even a Lamborghini Aventador, and you can see that Money doesn't just kick. He drives.</p><h2 id=the-celebrity-friends>The Celebrity Friends</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Money Kicks has a rolodex that would make even the most social socialite green with envy as his status has allowed him to rub elbows with major names like Rihanna, Nikki Minaj,&nbsp;Shahrukh Khan, and <a href=#>Khloe Kardashian</a>.</p><p>While it's easy to write off these famous pals as a perk of his financial security, he's actually become a celebrity in his own right, amassing an Instagram following of over 1.8 million <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">since making his debut on the social network in 2013</a>. His <a href=#>YouTube channel</a> boasts over 2.8 million subscribers with his regular show, Sneaker Talk featuring celebrities like Wiz Khalifa, Tyga, and The Game. It all comes together to make him a viral sensation across the world with every push of the publish button. Still, hosting so many famous faces at his home can be a bit much at times.</p><p>“They all want to spend time on our family farm and see our tigers,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he confided to a Dubai-based newspaper</a>. “Sometimes I have to say no. I don’t have the time and it is tiring.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sorry, Khloe. Not today. I have a headache.</p><h2 id=the-kings-ambition>The Kings Ambition</h2><p>When your father is as successful as Belhasa's, you don't get to sit on your laurels and play with your cheetah all day. There are names to live up to and expectations to meet. For Rashed, those expectations are much higher than many of us can ever dream of facing on our own.</p><p>Currently, Money Kicks owns his own brand of <a href=#>streetwear clothing</a>. The homegrown fashion company, Kings Ambition, provides some high end merchandise that he and designer Ross Mackay proudly put forth. From bags to shirts, his ambition to make Kings Ambition the best it can be is unmatched.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with <a href=#>World of Faz</a>, Mackay summed up the venture by saying, "Kings Ambition was born out of Dubai and it’s something I’m proud of. I lived here for sometime before I launched my first collection. The fashion scene is new here and especially the streetwear element but it’s growing and I hope that in a few years the fashion scene here will be really picking up. When you look at every major city there’s a brand you think of. I hope to have that effect here in Dubai!"</p><p>As of this writing, Belhasa's net worth is estimated to be $2.2 Billion, ranking him at #18 on the list of richest Arab names. The boy with a future may be spending like there's no tomorrow, but there is a tomorrow and he looks like he's getting richer by the day. At 19 years old, the sky is still the limit for this Billion Dollar Dubai Heir.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Most Expensive Hotel Suites In Dubai</a></span></p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Economic Times</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Famous Birthdays</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>World of Faz</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SCMP</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6sLrEsmSkoZOgwG6w1JuYomWYmrazecGio6Whn6Ouqr7EaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
