Happy shopping!</p><p>If you think that all <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">one-piece swimsuits</a> are modest or matronly, think again! While they are certainly not as revealing or occasionally risqué as a two-piece bikini, you can still show a little skin while having <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a mono moment</a>.</p><p>We found a beautiful one-piece that lets you flaunt your figure — while still providing the tummy control that we love about these swimsuits. This <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CUPSHE suit</a> has everything we want for summer, and Amazon shoppers are just as obsessed with it as we are!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CUPSHE-Womens-Shirring-Design-V-Neck-Low-Back-One-Piece-Swimsuit-Orange.png><p><strong>Get the </strong><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CUPSHE Women’s Shirring Design V-Neck Low Back One Piece Swimsuit</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$29</a>, available at Amazon!

At first, you may be led to believe that bunched up fabric won’t flatter the stomach area, but it does the exact opposite. It serves as a camouflage of sorts, creating the illusion of a more toned tummy — and who doesn’t want that at the beach? It’s no surprise that many reviewers have picked that as their favorite feature!</p><p>Shopper after shopper proclaims that the “flattering” look of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">these suits</a> is so major. The “quality fabric” exceeded expectations and they feel “very confident” whenever they wear it out and about. All of the positive vibes surrounding the product certainly make Us feel sure that it’s a total hit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CUPSHE-Womens-Shirring-Design-V-Neck-Low-Back-One-Piece-Swimsuit-Dark-Grey.png><p><strong>Get the </strong><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CUPSHE Women’s Shirring Design V-Neck Low Back One Piece Swimsuit</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$29</a>, available at Amazon!

We love the low V-neck on the triangle top of this suit, which can create cleavage. This suit comes in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">variety of colors</a>, and depending on which shade you pick, it can have a slightly different style.</p><p>Some of the suits have adjustable straight straps, and others have a halter-tie style. The bottoms of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">these one-piece suits</a> are slightly higher cut, and a bit cheeky — which is super cute. All around, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">these suits</a> are winners!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CUPSHE Women’s Shirring Design V-Neck Low Back One Piece Swimsuit</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$29</a>, available at Amazon!
