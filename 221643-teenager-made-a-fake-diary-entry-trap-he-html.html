A 17-year-old tricked her stepmother into proving that she had been going through her diary. However, she worries that her method may have been a tad over the top.

Wanting a broader perspective, she told her story on an online forum.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>THE BACKSTORY</strong></p><p class=dh>The teenaged girl's mom and dad are divorced. Her mom is a doctor, and with the novel coronavirus pandemic, her mom had been "super paranoid" about anyone living with her. So, the teen had been quarantining with her father and stepmom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/7a8ec1cdb7dcb26281a0ed70282eb063.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>A diary with a lock on it to keep the contents private. | Source: Pixabay.</p><p class=dh>The relationship between her and stepmom is "weird." Even though they've known each other for two years, her stepmom stepped over the line. The young teen keeps a diary with "a lot of private stuff," and her stepmom read it.</p><p class=dh>Actually, the stepmom did much more than read it. The stepmom used some of the information in a very manipulative way - pretending that the teen actually said things to her written in the diary. Then the teen got the idea to make sure she had her facts straight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/a0c7b02e523607b936d53f31b4fe4703.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>A "private" sign hanging from chains. | Source: Pixabay.</p><p class=dh>"I realized a lot of the stuff I wrote down was stuff she was telling him, so I decided to come up with a plan to see if I was right. I wrote a fake entry basically saying stuff I would never do in a million years and set the trap," the teen <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/i2lo6g/aita_for_making_a_fake_diary_entry_to_catch_my/>wrote</a>.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>WHEN THE TRAP SPRUNG</strong></p><p class=dh>The teen's suspicions were confirmed when her father called her back home to come and atone for what she "did" shortly after her stepmom snooped and tattled about the fake diary entry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/bd25fcc1ec19ac7df6237dd2b3b298da.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>The stories told by words written in a book. | Source: Pixabay.</p><p class=dh>But when the young teen returned home and exposed her stepmom, things didn't quite go as she expected, as she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/i2lo6g/aita_for_making_a_fake_diary_entry_to_catch_my/>added</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I told her it was fake, knew she read my diary and refused to speak to her. My dad came in and I told him and he didn’t believe me."</p><p class=dh>Concerned that she may have acted unfairly, the 17-year-old asked for opinions, which streamed in with one mainstream thought - it was a "massive invasion of privacy," and that needs to be addressed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/0e668a27c9929f5caa0c0b34bb86d000.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>A privacy warning sign. | Source: Pixabay.</p><p class=dh>What would you do from this point forward if you were in the teen's shoes?</p><p class=dh>However, in stepmom-related news, <a class="me a" href=#>Gisele Bündchen</a> has a whole other perspective on parenting in a blended family.</p><p class=dh>While she ditched the term stepmom, the model sees her role as that of a "bonus mom." Married to Tom Brady, he has a son named Jack from a previous relationship, and Gisele sees the 12-year-old as a "blessing" in her life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtpam5kaHq1scSnmKCdomK6orDEZphmnpGgsm6wyJqpsmWVo8GzxYytqZqoXZ2yb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
