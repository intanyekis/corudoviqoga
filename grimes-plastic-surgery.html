To unwind, I spend 30-45 minutes on an inclined hike at 4-4.5 miles per hour, which is arguably the most efficient workout.”</p><p>Fans began to wonder if the Art Angels artist was trolling them when she went on to say that she replaced part of her eyeball with plastic to treat seasonal depression.</p><p>“I’ve also eliminated all blue light from my vision through an experimental surgery that removes the top film of my eyeball and replaces it with an orange ultra-flex polymer that my friend and I created in the lab this past winter to treat seasonal depression,” she added.</p><p>Fans speculated in 2018 that the mother of two — who shares son X A-Xii and daughter Exa Dark Siderael Musk with Tesla CEO Elon Musk — had fillers.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Grimes-Plastic-Surgery-2022.webp alt=Grimes-Plastic-Surgery-2022 width=750 height=938 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“It does appear that she has had fillers…?” “I’ve been thinking the same, she looks beautiful with or without,” one Reddit user wrote, while another agreed, “I’ve been thinking the same, she looks beautiful with or without.” Meanwhile, a third opined, “This looks like different lighting, makeup, and Photoshop to me, but OK.”</p><p>Grimes later admitted to getting lip fillers, according to reports.</p><p>Although the songwriter rarely discusses her appearance, she recently shut down haters who criticized her appearance. Grimes wrote on Instagram in April 2020, “People make fun of my big nose and weird face, but I think it’s cool to be strange.” It took me a long time to figure out how to make makeup look good because standard tricks don’t work.
