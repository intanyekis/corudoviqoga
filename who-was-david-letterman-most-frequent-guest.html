Whether David's team reached out or he asked celebrities for favors (at least in the early days), there was no shortage of big names to choose from.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet not every interview was a slam dunk, and <a href=#>Letterman did catch heat for interviews that were often deemed inappropriate</a>. There are probably hours of interview footage that are uncomfortable to watch today, even for Letterman himself.</p><p>Fortunately for the host, that didn't keep celebrities like <a href=#><strong>Sofia Vergara</strong></a>, <a href=#>who called Letterman out for some awkwardness</a>, from coming back for multiple different interviews over time. Tons of other celebrities appeared on The Late Show a handful of times, and a dozen is not unheard of.</p><p>However, there are a select few who racked up more appearances.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Billie Eilish Surprised David Letterman After She Revealed What Caused Her Tics During Their Interview</a></span></p><p>Will Ferrell, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Samuel L.

Even <a href=#><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a> appeared on the show more than 20 times, more times than <strong><a href=#>Julia Roberts</a></strong>, Michael J.

Jack Hanna is one guest who has appeared on The Late Show with David Letterman a whopping 68 times, from 2002 to 2015.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Guests Who Almost Walked Out Of Their Interview With David Letterman</a></span></p><p>Jack sometimes appeared on the show as a guest, but he also appeared numerous times as an "Animal Expert" who interacted with other guest stars or delivered animal facts.

Before passing away in 2020, Regis appeared on countless shows, including talk shows, as well as his own series.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Regis graced Letterman's show for a whopping 125 episodes</a>, often as a guest but other times under a "cameo," sometimes during surprise appearances. Regis' first time on the show was in 1993, during the show's first season, though he previously appeared on another late show with David Letterman, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Regis Philbin Took A Shot At Kelly Ripa Backstage Prior To Her First Show</a></span></p><p>His last appearance was during the show's final season in 2015. The only shows Regis appeared on more than The Late Show are his own (Who Wants to Be a Millionaire) and Live with Kelly and Mark, as he was formerly a host/co-host.</p><p>What's surprising is that David and Regis were said to have feuded back in the day, so it's odd to think that Regis would continue to appear on his enemy's show if that was the case.</p><h2 id=did-david-letterman-and-regis-philbin-get-along>Did David Letterman And Regis Philbin Get Along?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/what-happened-between-david-letterman-and-regis-philbin_.jpg><p>Philbin also appeared on Late Night with David Letterman back in the '80s through the '90s, which was the same timeframe when the two were <a href=#>rumored to be feuding</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The story goes that Regis inadvertently snubbed David backstage, and then David gossiped about it. Letterman ultimately flipped Regis off when he came on the show, something that Philbin wasn't sure was a joke.</p><p>Ultimately, it seemed that the two worked things out, because, as David noted in a tribute after Regis' passing, the late talk show host was "on our show a million times, always the best guest we ever had."</p><p>There's also the fact that even after moving shows, David continued to have Regis appear on his show regularly, only saying good things about him in public and on the show. Whatever the case was with their long-ago feud, the drama was done and over with by the time Regis passed away.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrK60ecOaraKcXaGytcDEq6Sapl2ivLTAjJ%2Bpnqmlmru1ecaunKysXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
