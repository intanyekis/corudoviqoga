There have also been rumors that the actor had an <a href=#>inappropriate relationship with minor activist Tokata Iron Eyes</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/3-4.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The North Dakota resident had a temporary order of protection issued against Miller by the Standing Rock Sioux tribal court. The youth leader claims in the protective order that the Flash actor "physically and emotionally harmed" her.</p><p>Several months before Iron Eyes' parents filed a lawsuit against Miller, the controversial actor was arrested in Hawaii in March 2022 and charged with disorderly conduct and harassment.</p><p>Based on a police report obtained by Page Six, the Fantastic Beasts actor was reportedly "yelling obscenities and became agitated when people began singing karaoke." After entering a plea of no contest, they were given a $500 fine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/4-3.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Miller was <a href=#>arrested once more in Hawaii</a> three weeks after the karaoke incident, this time on charges of throwing a chair at a woman's head. Yikes! The event occurred in a party at a private property in Pahoa on the Big Island of Hawaii, according to a press statement from the Hawaii Police Department.</p><p>“During the course of their investigation, police determined that the individual, later identified as Ezra Miller, became irate after being asked to leave and reportedly threw a chair, striking a 26-year-old female on the forehead, resulting in an approximate half-inch cut,” the release read.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Joss Whedon Had To Use A Double After Gal Gadot Wouldn't Shoot An Edgy Scene With Ezra Miller</a></span></p><p>The actor's charges in Hawaii were not the first time he displayed bizarre behavior in public. Kevin Armstrong, who appeared as an extra in the 2019 miniseries The Stand, claims that Miller <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shouted, spit, and interrupted the director during filming</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It was disgusting and horribly unprofessional,” Armstrong said of the actor's antics to Insider.

It ended up in this situation of binding endless friendship that persists to this day. It’s a case of absolute serendipity and synchronicity. It just occurred that way. And that definitely was a lucky turn for us.”</p><p>In an old interview, they revealed that Watson was one of their "closest friends" and that they became fast friends while working together on the project. Miller claims that the two developed a close "brother and sister" relationship through sharing a hotel room next to each other.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Scandalous Things Ezra Miller Has Actually Done</a></span></p><p>This seems to be the case, since Miller claims that he immediately contacted his Perks of Being a Wallflower co-star Emma Watson after being cast in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Beasts is a precursor to the Harry Potter film series, in which Watson has appeared since she was very young.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1-4.png><p>"Emma was the first person I called," Miller said with a chuckle during a New York press conference for the film.</p><p>"I think, usually, if you know someone who has worked with anyone who you are about to work with, it seems rational to check in and find out what you are plunging into. And, fortunately, when I called Emma, I was given good news. She told me what a magical experience it was for her.”</p><p>Despite their obvious closeness, it is unknown whether or not they still stay in touch or if Watson has begun to avoid Miller as a result of his negative publicity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-watson-was-criticised-for-speaking-out-about-j-k-rowling-but-not-ezra-miller>Emma Watson Was Criticised For Speaking Out About J.K. Rowling, But Not Ezra Miller</h2><p>Despite claims from fans that she has <a href=#>consistently spoken out against J.K. Rowling's transphobic position</a>, Watson has remained silent on the subject of Miller. Watson is just as much a coworker of Miller's as Rowling is, so it's only fair that she speaks out against Miller's behavior.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/instar44075043.jpg><p>Fans of Watson have stepped out to defend her, arguing that she should not be held responsible for comments or actions that she did not make. No matter how close she is to Rowling or Miller, they feel she shouldn't have to act as a spokesperson for them.</p><p>But that hasn’t protected her from the people that see her stance as hypocritical.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Watson, who claims to be close friends with Ezra Miller, maintained a mysteriously quiet profile as Miller gained attention for his global rampage and questionable behavior.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Led To The Downfall Of Ezra Miller's Career</a></span></p><p>The problem was not limited to individuals in the profession but resembled a chain of events that was getting increasingly dangerous to whoever occurred to cross Miller's path.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/6.png><p>Despite being widely recognized as a staunch advocate for women's rights, Watson did not intervene when Miller began making uncomfortable attempts toward a number of women.</p><p>Those among the Twitterati who had long said that Watson was only a pseudo-feminist catering to the underlying power of men were emboldened by her silence when she once said, "Some of the best feminists I know are men."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Twitter users are becoming increasingly frustrated, disillusioned, and antagonistic toward the actress because of her refusal to comment on the allegations made against her Perks of Being a Wallflower co-star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicpqWRYsSiwNKopWaeop6yr7DSZq6irJhisru%2BwGakoqScmr9ur86nq6unppq%2FtLXErGSanqSav268xKuirGWfm3qjscinnmaZXayurbjFpaawnaJk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
