After all, neither of them have actually been involved in any aspect of this dramatization of their lives at all. This is about them, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they haven't had any say over the series at all.</a> Fans are now sharing their thoughts on the drama that has had absolutely no influence from the actual people it's based on.</p><h2 id=lily-james-was-a-39-terrible-casting-decision-39><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Lily James Was A 'Terrible Casting Decision'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pamela Anderson is such a defined actress with a look and a personality that are all her own. She had a very expressive personality and a unique aesthetic that many fans were not impressed to see duplicated. In fact, many fans feel that no matter how well Lily James transformed with her hair, makeup and costume choices, there is simply nobody that should ever try imitating the iconic character that Pamela Anderson portrayed. James' ability to pull off a believable version of Pamela Anderson was slammed by many fans that called this a "terrible casting decision."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Much Tommy Lee Spent On His Divorce From Pamela Anderson</a></span></p><h2 id=pamela-anderson-is-reportedly-unimpressed><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Pamela Anderson Is Reportedly Unimpressed</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are many fans who have greatly enjoyed tuning in to Pam & Tommy, but the real Pamela Anderson is definitely not among that group. A number of reports indicate that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pamela Anderson is not impressed </a>by having someone else depict her on screen, and she wants nothing to do with this program at all. <a href=#>She's not happy </a>that this went into production without any feedback from her whatsoever and has refused to publicly acknowledge the series in any way.</p><h2 id=tommy-lee-thinks-it-39-s-39-cool-39><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Tommy Lee Thinks It's 'Cool'</span></h2><p>Based on their real-life relationship profile, perhaps it isn't so shocking that Tommy Lee's views of Pam & Tommy are far different than Pamela Anderson's. This seems to be yet another thing that Tommy and Pam don't agree on, as he has given Seth Rogen's depiction of his life the green light. Lee has indicated that he thinks this is a 'cool' idea and has stated that he believes his dramatic relationship with Pamela Anderson would certainly pack a lot of entertainment value and is a story worth telling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kudos-go-out-to-the-makeup-artist><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Kudos Go Out To The Makeup Artist</span></h2><p>Naturally, Lily James doesn't resemble Pamela Anderson at all, and fans are now recognizing the enormous effort that goes in to filming each episode. The make-up team has had their work cut out for them, and with some skillful talent and some clever cosmetic techniques, they have managed to create a carbon copy of Pamela Anderson with precision and accuracy. Some are already suggesting this team stands a chance to take home some awards in this category.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Pamela Anderson Sells Her Malibu Home And Moves To Canada</a></span></p><h2 id=courtney-love-rose-to-pamela-anderson-39-s-defense><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Courtney Love Rose To Pamela Anderson's Defense</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Courtney Love is vehemently defensive of her friend, Pamela Anderson, and is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">completely dismayed</a> by the thought that anyone would ever try to reproduce her image and tell her story. Especially this particular story. <a href=#>Courtney Love has gone on record</a> to remind the public that many of the depictions of Anderson and Lee's relationship stemmed from real-life moments that had negative effects on Pamela's life and truly affected her on an emotional level. She's upset that this is being released given Anderson's disapproval.</p><h2 id=seth-rogen-makes-it-39-oh-so-good-39><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Seth Rogen Makes It 'Oh So Good'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seth Rogen has a huge following, and his fans are definitely on board with this project. He has a reputation of finding the most entertaining ways of captivating an audience, and the fact that he is one of the masterminds behind Pam & Tommy has instantly generated a lot of fan interest. His creative spirit and reputation for being wildly successful at his job has meant that fans are tuning in to see what his energy has been put towards in recent months.</p><h2 id=lily-39-s-transformation-is-wildly-impressive><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Lily's Transformation Is Wildly Impressive</span></h2><p>The before and after photos of Lily James are dramatically different, and fans are in awe of just how drastic and impressive her transformation really is. She was able to completely change her look, and as far as imitation goes, it's hard to get much closer in appearance than Lily James as Pamela Anderson. In spite of the fact that not everyone is a fan of the concept of retelling this story, it's hard to deny that Lily James managed to capture the essence of Pamela Anderson's aesthetics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Tommy Lee's Full Relationship History (Besides Pamela Anderson)</a></span></p><h2 id=why-is-this-a-series-release-it-all><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Why Is This A Series? Release It All...</span></h2><p><a href=#>The story of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee</a> is just about as juicy as celebrity marriages get, and many fans want to soak up every moment of this drama. Their relationship was so colorful and entertaining in real life, that most fans imagine it will truly light up on the small screen. Everything about this couple is so interesting that it's hard to look away, and fans are wishing this series would just be completely released to them all at once so that they can follow through to the end and get their entertainment fix.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=this-targets-a-singular-age-group><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>This Targets A Singular Age Group</span></h2><p>Some comments on social media suggest that the story of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee is not one that is familiar to the younger generation, thus making it a flop to the majority of audiences. Given the fact that only "40 something's" would really recall just how captivating this couple really was when they were an item, it seems to be the isolated demographic who would want to tune in now. Much of the younger generation is oblivious to the nuances in Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson's relationship, and without the backstory, it may be tough for all audiences to truly connect to this program.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sebastian-stan-is-very-convincing-as-tommy-lee><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Sebastian Stan Is Very Convincing As Tommy Lee</span></h2><p>As far as acting skills go, Sebastian Stan is really making waves. His depiction of Tommy Lee seems to be on point and quite impressive with many fans praising his skills and swooning over his new look. It seems this role was made for him, as he seamlessly encompasses all that Tommy Lee's character is known for. He, too, has transformed for the role, and the general consensus among fans is that Sebastian Stan is perfectly cast and is mesmerizing in this light.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Facts About Pamela Anderson's Life Growing Up In A Small Town</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrOiutJmqpqxmaO0brzApmSappRiwbC5zLJkrJ2inrK0ec%2BapJ6kkWKur7DEq6qopl2osrW0jKumoJ2eYrmquNhmoZqllah8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
