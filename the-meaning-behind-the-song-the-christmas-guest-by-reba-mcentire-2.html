The song beautifully captures Conrad’s anticipation and excitement as he prepares his humble home for the arrival of his special guest.</p><p>Conrad’s friends leave him alone, but he remains hopeful and waits patiently for the Lord to appear. Unfortunately, when Conrad hears a knock on his door, it is not the Lord but a shabby beggar in need of warmth and shelter. Without hesitation, Conrad selflessly helps the man by providing him with shoes and a coat.</p><p>But Conrad’s disappointment grows as he realizes that the Lord has not come yet. Once again, he hears a knock on his door, and this time it is a destitute old lady seeking a place to rest. Conrad offers her a warm drink and a seat at his table, even though he still longs for the Lord’s arrival.</p><p>Just when Conrad begins to lose hope, he hears another cry for help outside his door. It is a lost child who has strayed from her family, desperately searching for a way back home. Conrad guides her back to her loved ones, although his heart grows heavy knowing that the Lord has not come.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Unexpected_Revelations></span>Unexpected Revelations<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Feeling disheartened, Conrad retreats to his room and prays, questioning why the Lord did not come to visit him. But in a moment of silence, Conrad hears a gentle voice explaining that the Lord did indeed come to his home three times.</p><p>The beggar with bruised feet, the hungry woman, and the lost child were all embodiments of the Lord. Conrad had shown kindness and love to each of them, unknowingly welcoming the Lord into his home with his selfless actions.</p><p>The song concludes with the realization that love is the greatest gift of all. The Lord expresses gratitude for the warmth and love Conrad extended to those in need, affirming that Conrad’s acts of compassion and generosity made him the true Christmas Guest.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Message_of_Compassion_and_Generosity></span>A Message of Compassion and Generosity<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>“The Christmas Guest” serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of compassion, kindness, and love, particularly during the holiday season. It beautifully conveys the idea that by reaching out and helping others in need, we welcome the presence of the divine into our lives.</p><p>This song resonates deeply with me because it reminds me of the true spirit of Christmas – to give selflessly and to love unconditionally. It teaches us to be open-hearted and to see the presence of God in every person we encounter.</p><p>So, as we gather with our loved ones this Christmas, let us remember the powerful message behind Reba McEntire’s “The Christmas Guest.” Let us be like Conrad, opening our hearts and homes to those in need, knowing that in doing so, we are welcoming the love and warmth of the Lord into our lives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminnJnBqrnEpqysoZNjsLC5jq2fnmWdmq6vtc2gZJudmJ67pXnToZxmq5%2BjtG7Ax55knKCinsC1ucCsZKCtlajBbq7YZqmempFiuqSxza2gq51dZ3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
