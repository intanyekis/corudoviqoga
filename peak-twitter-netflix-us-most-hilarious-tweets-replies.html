It's a global phenomenon that has welcomed itself into our homes and has taken hundreds of hours from us, thanks to its award-winning shows and movies. While Netflix US streams crowd favorites like&nbsp;Friends,&nbsp;Elf, and&nbsp;Star Wars: The Last Jedi (to name a few), they also stream their own movies and shows that are only getting better with time. But there's another part to Netflix that's making the media provider even more popular: its Twitter account.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Netflix US has dominated the Twitter-sphere and found a way to be hilariously honest with a touch of troll. Let's take a look at 10 of the streaming service's funniest tweets and replies.</p><h2 id=leave-us-alone>LEAVE US ALONE!</h2><p>Netflix's original holiday film,&nbsp;A Christmas Prince,&nbsp;released in 2017 and was an instant holiday classic. The film told the story of a nosey journalist who makes her way into the kingdom of Aldovia, where she discovers a royal secret.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> 10 Crazy Things The Kardashians Have Bought Their Kids</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unexpectedly, she also finds herself falling in love with the future king and his family. Will this secret ruin the kingdom and Aldovia and her career? Or will her honesty be refreshing and needed to create an honorable monarchy? Fast forward two years and&nbsp;The Christmas Prince now has two sequels:&nbsp;A Christmas Prince: The Royal Wedding and&nbsp;A Christmas Prince: The Royal Baby. So, to answer Netflix's question as to who hurt us, they did by creating three movies!</p><h2 id=will-colin-firth-ever-keep-track-of-his-children>WILL COLIN FIRTH EVER KEEP TRACK OF HIS CHILDREN?</h2><p>English actor Colin Firth is an icon. He's done countless movies and has won many awards for his amazing talents. Funny enough, we needed Netflix to remind us that Colin Firth has been in two separate movies where he finds out he has a teenage daughter that he didn't know about. In&nbsp;What A Girl Wants,&nbsp;Colin plays an important member of Britan's political scene and is worried his American love child could ruin his career and current family. In&nbsp;Mamma Mia!, he plays&nbsp;Harry Bright â€” the *possible* father to Amanda Seyfried's character. When will Colin's characters keep track of his children!?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=don-t-be-sarcastic-with-netflix-emily>DON'T BE SARCASTIC WITH NETFLIX, EMILY</h2><p>The hilarious thing about Netflix's Twitter account is they're not afraid to troll other accounts. It doesn't matter if they're a subscriber or a competitor, they'll troll anyone who tries to diss them. (Honestly, other companies should follow suit. Their Twitter account is gold.)</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Got Their Start On Kids' Shows</a></span></p><p>Here, we see a Netflix viewer trying to be sarcastic with the streaming service for claiming&nbsp;The Magic School Bus was an exciting TV show. Contrary to Emily's thoughts, Netflix reminded her why the childhood favorite is so exciting in a hilariously graphic way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-tweet-that-went-viral>THE TWEET THAT WENT VIRAL</h2><p>There are many Netflix tweets that gave gone viral for their mic-drop appeal. Most recently, their question to their followers received thousands of hilarious replies by fellow brands, celebs, and viewers alike. Instagram tweeted "Double tap." MTV's&nbsp;Catfish tweeted "I was faking it the&nbsp;entire time." Pop-Tarts tweeted "Fill me up." The replies were so witty and genius, it made millions respect brands and celebs they wouldn't have thought twice about before.</p><h2 id=every-streamer-s-pet-peeve>EVERY STREAMER'S PET PEEVE</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I think thousands of Netflix streamers can say they appreciate the thought behind Netflix's "are you still watching?" pop up. It's a subtle nudge to see if you're still paying attention to the screen so Netflix can stop the movie or show so you don't lose your place.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Richest Streamers In The World, Ranked</a></span></p><p>However, it's also a constant reminder that we've been watching the service for hours and have done nothing with our day besides binge-watch an entire season of&nbsp; Gilmore Girls.</p><h2 id=netflix-s-own-love-letter-to-their-own-movie>NETFLIX'S OWN LOVE LETTER TO THEIR OWN MOVIE</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This meme is further proof that Netflix loves the content they're putting out there. After 2017s&nbsp;A Christmas Prince, viewers began wanting more and more holiday films. There's also something magical about the possibility of becoming a royal after growing up as a mere mortal in New York City as Amber did. And as we know, something similar happened with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, so we really can't rule this magical idea out. Nevertheless, in this meme, Netflix is subtly insisting that&nbsp;A Christmas Prince&nbsp;is Oscar-worthy.</p><h2 id=you-miss-100-of-the-shots-you-don-t-take>'YOU MISS 100% OF THE SHOTS YOU DON'T TAKE'</h2><p>For now,&nbsp;<a href=#>The Office </a>is still streaming on American Netflix and it's been a blessing to be able to see Michael, Jim, Dwight, and Pam every day (because yes, we watch&nbsp;The Office every day). In this Twitter exchange, Netflix originally tweeted a hilarious quote from Michael Scott during his meeting with David Wallace.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Every Cast Member Of The Office Net Worth</a></span></p><p>"This is something that I live by, and I always have, and I always will: Don't ever, for any reason, do anything, to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what, no matter where, or who you are with, or where you are going, or where you've been, ever, for any reason whatsoever." One fan tweeted that it was Michael Scott who said it, while Netflix joked around and said it was former hockey player Wayne Gretzky, thanks to Michael quoting him (and later, quoting himself).</p><h2 id=don-t-you-ever-dis-brie-larson>DON'T YOU EVER DIS BRIE LARSON</h2><p>In 2017, Brie Larson directed&nbsp;Unicorn Store; a movie about a&nbsp;playful painter who's trying to find herself. The quirky comedy had mixed reviews but it can't be denied that Brie Larson has incredible talent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Netflix released the trailer for&nbsp;Unicorn Store, one viewer was pretty judgmental about Brie Larson's work. But did Netflix take the criticism sitting down? Oh, heck no. They listed all of her incredible accomplishments to show this random Twitter user just how big of a deal Larson was.</p><h2 id=thank-you-mean-girls>THANK YOU, MEAN GIRLS</h2><p>Thanks to Tina Fey's&nbsp;Mean Girls, the world has even more hilarious scenes to quotes. Starring Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert, and Amanda Seyfried,&nbsp;Mean Girls was a movie revolving around life as a teenage girl. Whether young women found it relatable or not, the movie was still outstanding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the film, Lindsay's character goes through all the small moments she's had with her crush Aaron Samuels. "On October 3rd he asked me what day it was." Leave it to cheeky Netflix US to respond to Canada's tweet with "It's October 3rd."</p><h2 id=not-a-bad-stat>NOT A BAD STAT</h2><p>In August of 2017, the world had a solar eclipse. It's a moment when the new moon comes in between both the sun and the earth. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Time and Date</a>, the eclipse "blocks out the Sun's rays and casting a shadow on parts of Earth." Due to the visibility, millions of people took the time to find a place where they can see it go down (with goggles and eye protection, of course). And as it appears, there was a 10% drop in viewings during the eclipse, proving that for once, we cared more about our earth than Netflix!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Highest Paid Comedians On Netflix</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5noJqurHnTsKCtrJWneq%2Bx05%2BjorBdqsBuuc6sq2agmaGus7XOrqpmrKeasrW%2FjKucqaSZmsBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
