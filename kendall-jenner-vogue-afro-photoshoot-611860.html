“The image is meant to be an update of the romantic Edwardian/Gibson Girl hair which suits the period feel of the Brock Collection, and also the big hair of the ’60s and the early ’70s, that puffed-out, teased-out look of those eras,” says Vogue in a statement."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The photos were shot by Mikael Jansson, and nearly right away, Vogue’s Instagram comments were flooded with anger.</p><p>“They stay tryna turn white women into black women,” one comment read. “They rather pretend we don’t exist then give us credit. Ugh.” However, there were also messages of support from many social media users that stated that the outrage was more of an over-exaggeration.</p><p>“This is clearly curly hair, natural in most countries in the world so everyone needs to chill out,” a commenter wrote. “And even if it was Afro, what is the actual problem?”</p><p>The socialite and member of the Kardashian family is not a stranger to controversy.&nbsp;Jenner has been accused of <a href=# id=auto-tag_cultural-appropriation_1 data-tag=cultural-appropriation>cultural appropriation</a>&nbsp;in the past; in 2017, she and her sister Kylie were accused of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">appropriating Latinx culture</a> for a photo shoot promoting their fashion line.</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Fifteen years and 150 finalists later, the @CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund prize has created global stars, local heroes, a must-watch New York Fashion Week, and, most important, a true sense of community among designers of all ages and backgrounds—all with differing aesthetic and commercial aspirations—who communicate, collaborate, and essentially care for one another through the fun and not-so-fun times. Laura Vassar Brock—one of the founders of 2016 #CVFF winner Brock Collection—says, “We spoke to a few friends who had gone through it, and they all said the same thing: that the Fashion Fund is a life-changing experience. And indeed it was!” Tap the link in our bio to learn more.
