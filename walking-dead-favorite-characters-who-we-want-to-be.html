Around the edges, he was rougher than sandpaper making for a difficult and less than hospitable member of Rick's group. However, Merle could definitely&nbsp;always hold his own - an important trait for a world with or without a constant threat of&nbsp;walker attacks.</p><h2 id=hershel-greene-has-practical-farming-skills><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>14.

He was a family man through and through with a meditative yet strong sense of being, making for someone who holds himself and others to account.

Though she yo-yo'd&nbsp; a bit with her loyalty to the good guys and the bad, Sasha was always a strong presence and well-intentioned. She always stuck with her family, which is an admirable trait, plus, she&nbsp; was the group's sniper, which simply makes her awesome.</p><h2 id=12-paul-jesus-rovia-has-it-all><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>12.&nbsp; Paul "Jesus" Rovia Has It All</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/the-walking-dead-episode-705-jesus-payne-1200x707-interview.jpg><p>Paul, or Jesus as he is more commonly known, was an awesome presence on TWD. He was a hippy-dippy type who could more than hold his own - a winning combination in everyone's book. Jesus&nbsp;espoused living in harmony with one another, however, when push came to shove/walkers&nbsp;tried to bite off your face,&nbsp;Jesus also showed off his exceptional combat skills and ability to survive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=morgan-jones-isn-t-done-surviving><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>11.

He was often a voice of reason for Rick to listen to, even when he was struggling to overcome the death of his wife, and then his son at the hands of his undead wife.

She was a bit irksome in the show's early seasons with the writers struggling to write her as a compelling character. However, she has since become a mainstay and one of the very few remaining characters from the show's original cast. The fact that she has gone on such a formidable 'hero's journey' makes her a person to aspire to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=carl-grimes-came-into-his-own-eventually><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>8.

He was able to hold Rick to account, and did stray a little from the good side for a bit, but in the end his good nature carried him to the end.

Being the daughter of Hershel and wife of Glenn may have instilled a kind-heart in her, however, Maggie can be fierce,&nbsp;which has made&nbsp;her a strong leader in her own right&nbsp;as well as a loyal and smart ally to Rick and the others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">3 Ways Michonne's Exit From The Walking Dead Could Happen</a></span></p><h2 id=negan-gets-the-job-done><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>5.

Sure, he's fairly sadistic and twisted (which are not things we aspire to be), but he is also a very capable, tactician-minded and strong guy who has been a thorn in the sides of walkers just as much as he's been an evil antagonist to the good guys. Plus, we have seen that Negan does have heart in him... it's just difficult for him to tap into... when he's bashing heads in with&nbsp;Lucille (his barbed baseball bat).</p><h2 id=rick-grimes-is-natural-born-leader><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>4.

He was the star of the show right from the beginning, on top of being the leader of his group of survivors for many many years. However, Rick is very much fallible and often struggled with leading and being a strong source of leadership to his friends and family (making him a great source of internet memes...). But&nbsp;Rick always persevered, fought the good fight, and never gave up, making him someone we can all look up to.</p><h2 id=glenn-rhee-is-the-ideal-everyman><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>3.

Glenn was that all-around nice guy that everyone wanted to be friends with - hence how he ended up with Maggie and with such loyal friends around him.&nbsp;It took Glenn a while to acclimatize and toughen up for the zombie apocalypse, but we was resourceful and able to survive on his own even from the beginning.&nbsp; We will never forgive you for this one, Negan.</p><h2 id=michonne-makes-survival-look-easy><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>2.

She may have started off a bit gruff and not as cuddly as Rick's fellow group members but you really can't blame her - she was trying to survive the end of the world and she had gone through quite the traumatic ordeal herself. She is like the noble ninja warrior of TWD, with her samurai sword always close at-hand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=daryl-dixon-does-it-best><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Daryl Dixon Does It Best</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/daryl.jpg><p>Daryl has arguably gone through the greatest shift in character over the many seasons of TWD.&nbsp;Even from the beginning, he was always a few steps above his loathsome brother, Merle. However, for a long time, Daryl was a loner (a dangerous one at that), and it has only been somewhat recently that his kind heart has begun to shine, melting hearts while still&nbsp;endlessly kicking butt.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Little Details About Jeffrey Dean Morgan's Time On The Walking Dead</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiumqSbnruoecOemJ1llpbDsL7IrZxmm5iWv6Kv056prGWnnbxuw8RmrpqmpGLBsHnBnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
