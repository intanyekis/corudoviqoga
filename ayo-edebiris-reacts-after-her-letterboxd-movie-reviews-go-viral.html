“I’m a comedian.

Anything I say online, I think I would say to somebody’s face,” she told reporters following the <a href=#>Emmy Awards</a> on Monday, January 15. “I have a Letterboxd [account] because I love movies, I love TV, I love this industry. I know how hard it is to make something. I respect everything that’s ever been made.”</p><p>Edebiri, 28, has been rubbing elbows with A-listers at various awards shows after scoring numerous nominations for her role in <a href=#>The Bear</a>, but the actress has no regrets about what she’s said in her reviews.</p><p>Letterboxd, for those who are unfamiliar, is a social media platform for movie viewers who wish they were film critics. It offers a rating system and diary feature for users to share their unfiltered thoughts about what they’ve watched. (Us Weekly staffers have referred to it as “Goodreads for movies.”)</p><p>Edebiri’s rather detailed reviews — including her hot take about <a href=#>Saltburn</a> starring <strong>Jacob Elordi</strong> and <strong>Barry Keoghan</strong> — went viral in the weeks leading up to the Emmys.</p><p>“My man’s is doing all of this but can’t eat runny eggs?” she wrote, referring to Keoghan’s character Oliver Quick’s hesitation about how his eggs were cooked despite his erotic actions throughout the <strong>Emerald Fennell</strong> film.</p><p>In a separate review, Edebiri shared her love of 2006’s The Departed, directed by <strong>Martin Scorsese</strong> and starring <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong>.</p><p>“I’m always a bit nervous talking about my past publicly just because people can have such a weird sense of familiarity but I dunno, f—k it. I’m proud of my work!” she wrote. “So, I was the dialect coach on this movie but ONLY for the word ‘microprocessors.’ I taught everyone how to say the word microprocessors in the funniest way possible and I did an amazing job.”</p><p>Edebiri is, in fact, a Boston native, but her young age raised a few red flags.</p><p>“If your thought to this is something along the lines of ‘that doesn’t make sense’ or ‘weren’t you around 10 at the time of production?’ — to you I say, shame. Shame on you. Whatever happened to listening to women’s stories? Christ,” Edebiri’s review continued. “Anyway your prejudices aside, I love this movie, I love rewatching this movie, I love the performances, I love Alec Baldwin hugging a man saying ‘the patriot act’ and I love being from Boston.”</p><p>Edebiri isn’t the only member of her family who has become obsessed with Letterboxd. The actress’ dad has his own profile with rather prolific reviews.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“My dad also has a Letterboxd, he’s here,” she also told reporters after the Emmys on Monday. “He’s popping off, he’s networking right now.”</p><p>Edebiri’s dad went viral in September 2023 for <a href=# rel=noopener>his review</a> of her movie Bottoms.</p><p>“It is one of the best comedy I have seen all year,” he wrote. “In the interest of self disclosure, Ayo is my daughter.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJiyp12asaauyKugrGWimq6kwNJmmJ%2Bslad6qbHRZqOerKSav6O7151kpqemnrJuvsSvoJ6vo2K0sHnVoqmapF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
