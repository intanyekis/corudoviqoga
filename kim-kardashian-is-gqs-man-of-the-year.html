She explained to the magazine that her “interest” in menswear was inspired by her father, who died in 2003 at age 59. The TV personality shared that her father favored luxury labels like Gucci and was always dressed to the nines.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Kim shared that Robert Sr. also influenced her obsession with hard work and financial stability.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“‘I know you’re going to be OK,’” Kim said her father told her shortly before his death. “‘It’s almost like I can see ahead. I know you’re going to be OK, but just take care of your siblings for me. Just make sure you take care of them,’” Kim recalled her father saying.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Kim didn’t take those words lightly, she told GQ, adding that his wishes made her “make decisions differently.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Kim is also instilling the appreciation of hard work in her children.

She has a table and chairs and fans to keep herself cool. She makes signs. She stays there for hours and hours. Her friends help, so she splits the money with them.”&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In addition to Skims, Kardashian’s business portfolio includes her skincare label, <a href=#>SKKN by Kim</a>.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Most recently, Kim entered the private equity investing world when she joined forces with equity executive <strong>Jay Sammons</strong> to start <a href=#>Skky Partners</a>.
