From launching your website and app (and it literally being on top trending charts) to walking in NYFW, it’s been a privilege to watch you accomplish your goals, and I know you’re just getting started. I love you and happy birthday. Like this photo if we should have 5 kids, comment for 6.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Bachelor Nation was introduced to Godwin when she appeared as a contestant on<a href=#><strong> Colton Underwood’s</strong> </a>season 23 of <a href=#>The Bachelor</a> in 2019.
