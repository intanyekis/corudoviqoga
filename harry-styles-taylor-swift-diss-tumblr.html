This fan reminded people that if you’re harassing Calvin, you’re also harassing Taylor.&nbsp;But the post also destroyed&nbsp;any hope of Haylor ever happening again. “If you think Calvin is a bad person but you keep sending him hate on SM, you are just as bad as you think he is,” the fan wrote. “He is the man Taylor chose to be with, I’m sorry if you live in fantasy land and you think this relationship is a cover up or if you think that a relationship that has been f***ing dead for years is gonna ‘rise’ (with a dude who had no maturity at all).” Taylor allegedly liked, then unliked,&nbsp;this post, but&nbsp;it was long enough for Haylor fans to notice. And they’re super pissed at her because by liking it, she seems to agree that Harry was “immature.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>It’s a lot to process, but at least Harry isn’t upset — he’s just amused.&nbsp;What do YOU think, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>? Are you glad Harry isn’t upset?
