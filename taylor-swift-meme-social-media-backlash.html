According to the study, that is "1,184.8 times more than the average person's total annual emissions."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The information in Yard's report came from the @celebjets Twitter account. In the report, it says that 170 trips were taken on Swift's plane and it has spent over 22,923 minutes in air since the start of 2022. That would be the equivalent of 16 days. 80 minutes was revealed to be the average flight time and the aircraft traveled around 139.36 miles. The shortest flight lasted 36 minutes and it went from Missouri to Nashville, Tennessee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift's team, however, was quick to defend the singer. "Taylor's jet is loaned out regularly to other individuals," <a href=#>her representative told E! News</a>. "To attribute most or all of these trips to her is blatantly incorrect."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Reese Witherspoon Is A Swiftie? The Actress Can't Stop Gushing About Taylor's Newest Song</a></span></p><p>The report soon trended on Twitter and sparked several memes prior to the response from Team Swift.</p><p>Many users were posting videos of planes flying through the air. One caption read, "video of taylor swift going to get a glass of water." Another user wrote, "taylor swift going to her living room from her bedroom."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A particularly unique post came from a user who shared a clip from Lady Gaga's "Hold My Hand" music video, in which a plane flies very close to Gaga's head. The user called it Swift's "cameo" in the video.</p><p>Not all of her fans were joking around, however. Several Swifties left comments on Reddit, criticizing the "Blank Space" singer.</p><p>"This is very shocking to me, honestly. More and more celebs are emphasizing the importance of reducing emissions, but it's these outrageous overconsumptions that need to be curbed," wrote one fan. "I love Taylor, but I'd never take a statement from her about the climate seriously after seeing this. I really think she has the means to do better"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I love Taylor. I also have a strong negative opinion of celebrity private jet culture and think rich people in general have learned to prioritize their comfort and freedom over the rest of us having a safe climate, and I think this is morally wrong of her," added another.</p><p>Swift may reduce the number of times her private jet is used and she may not. What is clear, however, is that this is a common problem among celebrities and Swift isn't the only one who is guilty.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Inspired This Scene In Thor: Love And Thunder</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lnZq6pnnSqJqimZxiuqawyJpkm5mToLmiv8do</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
