That [day off] was the day of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. So I got on a plane that night, flew, played, got on a plane that night and then flew back.”</p><p>Sheeran performed “Stan” alongside Eminem for the <a href=# rel=noopener>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony</a> in November 2022. Slim Shady was clearly taken by the amount of travel and physical exhaustion Sheeran went through for him.</p><p>“He was like, ‘Anything you ever need,’ and I just said, then and there, ‘I’m coming to Detroit,’ so [let’s do that],” Sheeran said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ed-Sheeran-Shares-How-Difficult-It-Was-To-Get-Eminem-To-Join-Him-On-Stage-2.jpg><p>When asked whether he was worried about being ghosted by Eminem the night of the show, Sheeran said he wasn’t too concerned. “I was there [in Detroit] for a couple of days as well. He let me use his studio to record some stuff, so I sort of knew it was going to happen,” he said. “I gave him the out. Whenever I perform with people, I always say, ‘You can <a href=#>cancel last minute if you want</a>,’ so there’s never any pressure.”</p><p>While the live surprise was a success, there was one thing Sheeran couldn’t get Eminem to do: join him on the rotating circular stage he used for his Mathematics stadium tour. “I tried to get him on the revolve, and I think it was a bit too much,” said Sheeran. “Because I’ve been on it for 100 shows now, so I’m used to it, but it’s definitely different for people.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Sheeran celebrated the release of Autumn Variations, his second album of 2023, on Friday, September 29.
