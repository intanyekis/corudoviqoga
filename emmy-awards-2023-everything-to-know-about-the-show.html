The Television Academy announced in August 2023 that this year’s Emmys are now set to air in January 2024 because actors, writers and other entertainment workers continue to strike. Both the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) have been walking picket lines this summer after failing to agree to labor terms with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Both the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the <a href=#>Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA)</a> have been walking picket lines this summer after failing to agree to labor terms with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP).</p><p>Although fans have to wait a little longer for TV’s biggest night, there is a lot to look forward to when the awards show resumes. <a href=#>Succession</a>, which came to an end in May 2023 after four seasons, could get all the attention come January due to its Emmys nods. In fact, costars <a href=#><strong>Brian Cox</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jeremy Strong </strong></a>and <a href=#><strong>Kieran Culkin</strong></a> are all facing off for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series — and those are just three of the series’ 27 total nominations.</p><p>“I’m just delighted, and especially delighted to be in such wonderful company!”<a href=#> Succession’s <strong>Matthew Macfadyen</strong> shared</a> in July 2023 after learning he and costar <a href=#><strong>Nicholas Braun</strong></a> are both up for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. “We are of course nothing without our writers — thanks as always to Jesse and the gang … ‘buckle up, f–kleheads!”</p><p>Scroll down for more on the 2023 Emmys:</p><h3><strong>When Will the 2023 Emmys Take Place?</strong></h3><p>The Emmy Awards will air on Monday, January 15, from the Peacock Theater at L.A. Live in Los Angeles. The event was originally slated for September 18. The Creative Arts Emmys are now scheduled for the week prior, spanning two nights: Saturday, January 6, and Sunday, January 7.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Emmy-Awards-2023-Everything-to-Know-About-the-Nominees-2024-Air-Date-and-More2.jpg><h3><strong>Why Was the 2023 Emmys Pushed Back?</strong></h3><p>The awards show was <a href=#>postponed amid the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes in Hollywood</a>, which are fighting the AMPTP for higher wages and streaming residuals, as well as labor assurances about issues including the use of AI. <a href=#>Variety</a> reported in July 2023 that vendors and show producers were told their services were no longer needed on the original air date, September 18.</p><p>The <a href=#>WGA strike began in May 2023</a> and SAG-AFTRA followed in July 2023. According to SAG-AFTRA strike regulations, union members must stop filming struck projects and cannot attend press events and red carpets nor promote their films and shows until the strike is over. (Struck projects include films produced by major studios affiliated with the AMPTP, as well as streaming sites with similar deals and the big four networks: ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox.)</p><p>This year marks the first time the Emmys have been pushed back since September 2001 and the 9/11 attacks. The ceremony aired two months later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Emmy-Awards-2023-Everything-to-Know-About-the-Nominees-2024-Air-Date-and-More4.jpg><h3><strong>Who Is Nominated for the 2023 Emmys?</strong></h3><p>The nominees were announced in July 2023 with Succession leading the pack with 27 nods. The Last of Us, <a href=#>The White Lotus</a> and <a href=#>Ted Lasso</a> earned 24, 23 and 21 Emmy nominations, respectively.</p><p>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’s farewell season nabbed 14 nominations, while <a href=#>The Bear</a>’s debut season earned 13. Beef and Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story also received 13 nominations while Wednesday came in at 12. <a href=#>See the complete list of nominations, here</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Emmy-Awards-2023-Everything-to-Know-About-the-Nominees-2024-Air-Date-and-More3.jpg><h3><strong>Who Was Snubbed?</strong></h3><p>The perpetually snubbed <a href=#>Yellowstone</a> was <a href=#>shut out of this year’s nominations yet again</a>. The Western drama starring <a href=#><strong>Kevin Costner</strong></a> is one of TV’s most watched dramas but has been nominated for only one Emmy — Outstanding Production Design for a Narrative Contemporary Program in 2021 — since its 2018 premiere.</p><p>The <a href=#>Game of Thrones</a> prequel, <a href=#>House of Dragons</a>, didn’t receive a single actor nomination, much to fans’ dismay. <a href=#><strong>Harrison Ford</strong></a> of Shrinking, <strong>Sophie Nélisse</strong> of <a href=#>Yellowjackets</a> and <a href=#><strong>Elizabeth Olsen</strong></a> of Love & Death were also noticeably missing from the list nominations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Emmy-Awards-2023-Everything-to-Know-About-the-Nominees-New-Air-Date-and-More-2.jpg><h3><strong>Who Is Hosting the 2023 Emmys?</strong></h3><p>The Television Academy announced in December that <a href=#><strong>Anthony Anderson</strong></a> will host. He joins the ranks of recent emcees, including <a href=#><strong>Kenan Thompson</strong></a> in 2022, <a href=#><strong>Cedric the Entertainer</strong></a> in 2021 and <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></a> in 2020.</p><p>“With our industry’s recent challenges behind us, we can get back to what we love — dressing up and honoring ourselves. And there’s no better celebratory moment to bring the creative community together than the milestone 75th Emmy Awards,” the Blackish alum said in a statement. “When Fox asked me to host this historic telecast, I was over the moon that Taylor Swift was unavailable, and now I can’t wait to be part of the biggest night in television.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3><strong>Where Can Fans Watch the Emmys?</strong></h3><p>The Emmys are set to air live on Fox starting at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Keke-Palmer-Becomes-1st-Woman-to-Win-Emmy-for-Best-Game-Show-Host-in-15-Years-Almost-Speechless.jpg><h3>Who Won at the Creative Arts Emmys?</h3><p>Several stars won their Emmys during the Creative Arts ceremony one week before the primetime awards show. <strong>Storm Reid</strong> took home the award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series, and <strong>Keke Palmer</strong> made history as the first Black woman to win an Emmy for outstanding game show host. Meanwhile, <strong>Ed Sheeran</strong> won his first Emmy for his song “A Beautiful Game,” which was featured in the Ted Lasso season 3 finale. <strong>Derek Hough</strong> earned his fourth Emmy for Outstanding Choreography for Variety or Reality Programming for Dancing With the Stars. <strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong> and <strong>Rob McElhenney</strong> also won big as they took home five trophies for Welcome to Wrexham.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJympalirrit0Z2qZmpgZ4BusdWeqbKsmJ67qHnTqGSkpp%2BseqKuzq6rZqyYmnq0tM6wZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
