His wife, Ashley, used to be a Taz Angel. According to Urban Dictionary, Taz Angels are escorts that party all day and night in a home in Washington, DC.</p><p>In August 2016, his then-girlfriend Ashley posted a video of them practicing oral sex on Snapchat, which sparked an internet backlash against him.

The fight broke out outside of a club and was recorded on camera. On several social media platforms, videos of Ja Rule and Gotti arguing and trading insults with an unnamed individual were posted.</p><p>Unknown factors may have sparked the altercation, but Gotti has long advocated for the cessation of rap battle violence. Nobody was surprised to learn that Gotti and Ashanti had a close bond. There were rumors that the two were involved in a love connection in addition to their work partnership.</p><p>Despite the claims, however, according to Information Cradle, Gotti appeared on the Wendy Williams program and addressed the issue, stating that he never had a romantic or sexual relationship with the singer and that their relationship was only focused on music.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGiq3qou9OtoGadqGLEqrLEZpueml2hvLOxzbOmZp%2BZp7mnvsiepZ2rXZbAqbjEsmSmmaKpsq24xGaYp5xdq66tecyeqZyZlKR6qbXSZqeaq6Riv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
