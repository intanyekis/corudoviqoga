Since emerging onto the scene in the early 2000s, the reality star’s wardrobe has undergone many transformations.</p><p>From Juicy Couture tracksuits to <a href=#>custom Balmain</a>, the Selfish author has proved she isn’t afraid of bold clothing choices, often opting for eye-catching patterns or skin-baring cutouts — risking it all in the name of fashion.</p><p>When the California native became a household name — thanks to her family’s hit E! show, <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a>, the TV personality was obsessed with <a href=#>animal prints</a>. She would often step out in leopard patterned frocks teamed with chunky accessories like gold bracelets and thick belts.</p><p>Her style got a major upgrade when she got with her now-ex <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>. In 2013, the Skims founder <a href=#>attended the Met Gala</a> — for the first time — with the Chicago rapper, wearing a floral Givenchy gown that featured gloved sleeves. The look became a defining fashion moment for Kardashian, pushing her to test her style boundaries. With the help of West, Kardashian entered her Balmain era. Ahead of the former couple’s <a href=#>wedding in Italy in 2014</a>, the beauty mogul was spotted in a plethora of sparkly looks from the fashion house and her famous family members followed suit.</p><p>West continued to style the SKKN by Kim founder <a href=#>until their split</a> in February 2021, dressing her in monochromatic looks from his line Yeezy after the brand’s season one show in 2015. Afterward, Kardashian was consistently seen in pieces from the brand, including trendy PVC heels, sock booties and sheer dresses.</p><p>Another standout era from Kardashian came in 2019 when she sported a number of racy <a href=#>looks from Thierry Mugler</a>. At the Met Gala that year, she donned a jaw-dropping custom corset dress by the label that featured <a href=#>an extremely cinched waist</a>. Kardashian explained at the time via Instagram that she had to take corset breathing lessons to be able to walk in the design.</p><p>Fashion’s biggest night is where Kardashian shines. At the 2022 event, she turned heads — and caused controversy — when she attended the Met Gala in <a href=#>Marilyn Monroe’s historic Bob Mackie gown</a>. Although she only wore the crystal-covered piece on the red carpet and changed into a replica before heading inside, Kardashian was accused of damaging the dress by collector <strong>Scott Fortner</strong>.</p><p>Both Kardashian and Ripley’s Believe It or Not! — the museum that acquired the frock for a whopping $4.8 million in Los Angeles in 2016 — <a href=#>denied she ripped the number</a>.</p><p>In addition to her praise-worthy red carpet moments, Kardashian has become <a href=#>synonymous with the pantaboot</a> after aligning herself with Balenciaga. (She <a href=#>became an ambassador</a> for the brand in February 2022.) While she has sported pantaboots in the past, she made it clear the look was hers during her <a href=#>Saturday Night Live hosting debut</a> in October 2021. For her opening monologue, she wowed in a Barbie pink crushed velvet jumpsuit.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kardashian <a href=#>opened up about her wardrobe</a> in June 2022, explaining during a panel with Allure‘s editor-in-chief <strong>Jessica Cruel</strong> that her style is “future alien Barbie vibes.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see more of Kardashian’s standout style moments:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvKoqRmo5GnsaK%2Fx6KYp6tdqMG6uMRmnK%2BnnKrBqrvNZq5tcWNlhnJ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
