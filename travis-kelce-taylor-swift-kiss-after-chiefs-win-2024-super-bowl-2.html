Swift attended her first game in September 2023 and has continued to make waves in the sport since.</p><p>While the twosome kept their romance under wraps until her first public appearance at Arrowhead Stadium, she revealed in her TIME 2023 Person of the Year profile that she and Kelce had been together for a “significant amount of time” before bringing it into the spotlight.</p><p>“When you say a relationship is public, that means I’m going to see him do what he loves, we’re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don’t care,” Swift said in December 2023. “The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you’re seeing someone. And we’re just proud of each other.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKurmaaewG63xKWanmWklsatu9FmqrChlql6rLXSrGSanqSav26vx6Kcn6tdrLaveZFpaW1lo6q9pr6Mm6awpF1nfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
