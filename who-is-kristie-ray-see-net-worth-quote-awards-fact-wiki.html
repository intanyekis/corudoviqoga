She also appeared in the first season of “Abby’s Ultimate Dance Competition” with her daughter. She’s also known for her marriage to bodybuilder Shawn Ray. All of her efforts have helped put her net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Kristie Ray? As of late-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $500,000, earned through success in her numerous endeavors. She also owns a skin care salon and is a certified paramedic. As she continues her work, it is expected that her wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=kristie-ray-net-worth-500000></span>Kristie Ray Net Worth $500,000<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Prior to finding popularity in reality shows, Kristie was a gymnast, eventually leading her to become a fitness competitor. She also did some modelling work, before making her first appearance in the series “Abby’s Ultimate Dance Competition” in 2013, which is a contest between 12 boy and girl dancers, fighting for a spot at the prestigious Abby Lee dance academy; Kristie and daughter Asia had a spot during the first season; Asia would make it through the entire 10 episodes of the series, eventually winning third place in the competition. The mother-daughter duo would start to increase their net worth thanks to this opportunity.</p><p>Ray’s next appearance would be in “Dance Mom” during the show’s third season, and which follows the training of children in dance and show business under Abby Lee Miller. It also often shows interactions between dancers, instructors, and mothers. The show revolves around the Abby Lee Dance Company’s Junior Elite Competition Team, showing them as they prepare for and travel to various competitions. They are seen winning awards and the show is often identified with mothers becoming the rivals of each other on behalf of their daughters. Various staff of the Abby Lee Dance Company also appear as guests on the show. After appearing in the third season of the show, they left to prepare for the Nationals competition. The show has won several awards including multiple Kids and Teen Choice awards, however, it was also rife with controversy, especially since Miller is shown to be a strict instructor. It was later revealed that a lot of the teaching style show-cased in the series were all made up for the show. Abby was also later charged with concealing her income from her performances, leading her to be sentenced to one year and one day in prison, replaced in the meantime by Cheryl Burke. Despite that, the success of the show would create numerous spin-offs, including “Dance Moms: Miami”, “Abby’s Ultimate Dance Competition” and “Raising Asia”.</p><p>In 2014, “Raising Asia” would star with Kristie’s daughter in the spotlight. The show follows the family in hopes of helping Asia find her success in show business.
