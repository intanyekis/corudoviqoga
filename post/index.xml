天下の稲葉さんがバツイチの女性と結婚？と思うかもしれませんが、実は稲葉浩志さん自身も過去に離婚の経験があり、バツイチなのはお互い様なのです。
稲葉さんが若い頃に結婚していた相手の女性というのは、どのような方だったのでしょうか？（ギターの松本さんは一般人の女性でした）
稲葉さんの素敵な歌詞を見てる限りは、とても良い恋愛をしてきた方だと思うのですが、再婚前に前嫁とヨリを戻したいと引きずっていた話もあるので、相当な大恋愛だったのではないか？と。
いつ、どこで出会い、どうして離婚してしまったのか、わかる範囲でまとめてみたいと思います。
稲葉浩志と美紀の馴れ初めはB'zの打ち上げ（コンパニオンのバイト）。出会った当時は大学生 稲葉浩志さんと美紀さんが出会ったのは1990年代の前半です。
当時のB'zといえば、曲を出せば評判は良いものの、ギターの松本さんの意向でホール中心にライブを行っていた時期です。
そんな時期のライブの打ち上げの場にて、稲葉浩志さんと美紀さんは出会いました。
当時の美紀さんは長崎県の活水女子短期大学に在学する大学生でした。
広島出身の美紀さんは大学のある長崎でコンパニオンのバイトをしていたのですが、そこでライブの打ち上げに参加し、稲葉さんと出会ったのです。
稲葉さんはそこで美紀さんに惚れ込み、連絡を取り合う仲になったのです。
2人が交際に発展したのは、美紀さんが大学を卒業し、スチュワーデスになって上京した直後でした。
美紀は大学卒業後に上京し稲葉浩志と交際・同棲し結婚へ 美紀さんが大学生の頃は、稲葉さんとどのような連絡を取っていたのかは知られていませんが、初期のB'zに遠距離恋愛や会いたい気持ちを綴った曲があったので、その通りの恋愛をしていたのかもしれません。
美紀さんは長崎県の活水女子短期大学を卒業した後はANAの客室乗務員となりました。（1991年との説が濃厚です）
仕事のために上京すると、すぐに稲葉さんとの交際が始まり、極秘で同棲を始めました。一緒に住んでたのは六本木のマンションだそうです。
美紀さんが上京する頃にはB'zはチャート上位入りが当たり前の人気ロックユニットになっていたので、出会った頃よりも立派なロックスターでありました。
交際から4年目の1994年6月、ニュージーランドで挙式し、見事にゴールインとなりました。
よくある勘違い「売れる前の女と結婚」「デキ婚」「TERUや桜井和寿と一緒」 ここで多い勘違いなのですが、稲葉さんの初婚がGLAYのTERUさんやミスチルの桜井和寿さんと同じカテゴリーにされることが多いのですが、実際は全然違います。
稲葉さんの場合は”売れた後”に出会い、結婚も”デキ婚ではない”ことを頭に入れておいてほしいです。
稲葉浩志と美紀(元嫁)の離婚の原因は？浮気説も
学生時代のコンパニオンのアルバイトで稲葉浩志さんと出会い、
活水女子短期大学を卒業し、
ANAの客室乗務員になり、
上京を機に交際、六本木のマンションで同棲し、
そして結婚というのが美紀さんと稲葉さんの馴れ初めです。
六本木のマンションで同棲生活を送り、
１９９４年の６月にニュージーランドで挙式したそうです。
馴れ初めから結婚まで堅実にステップを踏んでるあたり、さすがは稲葉さんだなと思います。
子供も誕生してませんし、自分の将来を冷静に見据えた交際と結婚、そして離婚だったのかなと。
当初は白金のマンションで結婚生活をスタートされていたのですが、バンドが急激に売れ出し、長期ツアーが増えていったそうで、その頃に、二人の間に距離ができてしまったようです。
１９９５年の９月４日に離婚と、結婚生活は１年弱で終焉してしまいました。
美紀と稲葉浩志の離婚理由は忙しさ故のすれ違い？ 1995年9月4日にわずか1年3ヶ月の結婚生活にピリオドを打ってしまったふたり。
離婚の理由はなんだったのでしょうか？
急にミリオン級のヒット曲が出て、大型ツアーも増え、当時の稲葉さんは売れに売れまくってました。
そんな激務の稲葉さんは、当然、家にいることができませんでした。
ふたりの間に距離ができてしまい、次第に美紀さんの方から冷めてしまったそうです。
当時の美紀さんは新社会人とあまり変わらないぐらいの年齢なので、彼氏と楽しそうにしてる同年代と自分のギャップに傷ついていたことでしょう。
美紀さんの若さも、離婚の原因の１つだったと思います。
一部では稲葉さんがツアー先で他の女性と不倫をしていたとの説もありますが、そちらは証拠がありません。
稲葉浩志は離婚後も美紀との再婚を望んでいた？復縁は叶わず 美紀さんと離婚してしまった稲葉さんですが、別れたあとは稲葉さんの方が美紀さんに未練があったそうです。
稲葉さんは自分の関係者に、同じ子ともう一度結婚するかもしれないと話していた通りに、稲葉さんの中で美紀さんを諦めきれない気持ちがあったそうです。
しかし、離婚してから1年後の1997年に、元モデルで松崎しげるさんの元嫁である蓬田美奈子さんと出会い、同棲を始めていました。
結局、美紀さんと稲葉さんの復縁は叶うことがありませんでした。
もしかしたら、寂しさを紛らわるために焦った気持ちもあったのかもしれません。
そして、その女性が自分と同じ結婚で失敗してる女性で、ミュージシャンの忙しさに理解のある女性で運命を感じたのかもしれませんね。
稲葉浩志の現在と過去の自宅と年収(画像・動画) 元嫁と生活していた白金のマンションを出ていったあと、稲葉さんはどのような生活を送っていたのか？
楽曲も売れ出し、ライブではソールドアウトが続出し、急激に年収が上がったのも、この時期だったと思います。
その後の再婚までの期間は長くないので、ほとんど家に帰らずに海外と日本を仕事関連で行き来する生活だったと予想されます。
現在の稲葉さんは妻子持ちで、都内にでかい豪邸を構えているそうです。
その豪邸の総工費が７億以上にもなるそうです・・・さすがです。
しかし、ファンからの特定が早く、ネット上では早々と行き方などが乗せられています。
あれだけの目立つ豪邸なら、仕方ないのかも？
いや、仮にも子供もまだ高校生なので、余計なストレスがないか心配になりますね。
まだ兵庫にはスタジオの入った別荘があるそうで、そちらの総工費は９億近くしたそうな・・・。
毎回来るわけでもない場所なので、すごいですね・・・。
ちなみに都内の稲葉さんの自宅の場所は、渋谷の高級住宅街にあるそうです。
若者の街から少し離れた、落ち着いた場所ということです。
それでも都内へのアクセスは簡単で、仕事関係の付き合いも楽そうです。
過去にネットに書かれていた白金の住所は、おそらく前の嫁さんと住んでいた家でしょうか？</description></item><item><title>Chad Daybell Wiki, Age, Parents, Kids, Career, Wife, Biography, Ethnicity &amp;amp; More About Lori Vallow H</title><link>/chad-daybell-wiki.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/chad-daybell-wiki.html</guid><description>In recent years, the names Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow have become synonymous with a chilling and tragic tale that has captured the attention of the public and the media.
