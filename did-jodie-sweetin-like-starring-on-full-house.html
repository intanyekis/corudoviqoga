According to&nbsp;Ranker.com, she was 13, and she shared that this led to her abusing alcohol. She said,&nbsp;"There is a certain sense of loss when a series ends. It is kind of hard to figure out who you are when you've lost your job at age 13, when that was basically how you identified yourself."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ranker.com&nbsp;says that when Sweetin was 20 years old, she wasn't sure that she would return to Hollywood and act.
