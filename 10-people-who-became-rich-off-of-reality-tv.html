And many are capitalizing on their fifteen minutes, using their now famous names for book deals, advertisement gigs, speaking engagements and music careers.</p><p>A small slice of the "talent" below is just that, actual talent. But most of these now wealthy celebrities made their money the new-fashioned way: living out their unique lifestyles for all of us at home to watch.</p><h2 id=heidi-montag---net-worth-100-000>10.

Montag is currently estimated to be worth $100,000.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kody-brown-and-the-sisterwives---net-worth-300-thousand>9.
