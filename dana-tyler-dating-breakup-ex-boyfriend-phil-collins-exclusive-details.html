As mentioned, we found out that they started dating back in the year 2006.</p><p>They ended their love life when her boyfriend Phil dumped her in the year 2016. It might come as a shock to all of you that her husband reconciled with his former wife, <strong>Orianna Cevey&nbsp;</strong>and that is why he&nbsp;broke up with her.</p><p>It was a heartbreaking incident for Tyler and as expected, she took a break from her work at that time.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Dana-Tyler-Phil-Collins-300x200.jpg alt="Dana Tyler & Phil Collins" width=480 height=320 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Photo Credit: Mirror.co.uk</strong></p><p>Tyler, after some time, shared her breakup news via Facebook. Here are some of her statements,</p><p>‘I know most of you haven’t seen me lately in news reporting.’</p><p>‘For now, I will not be there, as I am taking a break. I will be back soon!’</p><p>From this year, 2017, Tyler hasn’t been involved in with anyone and is single.

Her previous boyfriend dumped her just because of that. Phil became attracted towards his ex-wife Orianne Cevey again after divorce and then dissolved his marriage to be with his ex-wife.</p><p><strong>Also, See: <a href=# rel=noopener>Famous comedian Bill Dana (Jose Jimenez) died at the age of 92!</a></strong></p><p>Phil enjoyed married life for almost 8 years and then divorced his wife in the year 2006. Soon after their divorce, Collins moved on with Dana whereas Cevey started going out with <strong>Charles Mejjati</strong>.</p><p>Phil and Orianne are parents to their two sons, <strong>Nicholas</strong> and <strong>Mathew</strong>. In 2014, Cevey had a horror injury which paralyzed her back. The Doctors told her she’ll never walk again and she contemplated suicide.</p><p>It was at this horrible time that Phil lends his hands towards her. And it seems this must have been the trigger that led to Phil leaving his wife for Cevery.</p><p>When Orianne was asked about her relationship with Phil, she replied:</p><p>‘We’re in love. But it is not like before. The first timers, lovers be together in excitement while second timers be more mature.’</p><p>But, Phil Collins revealed the real reason for ending love life with Dana Tyler:</p><p>‘We made mistakes and realized that. In future, if our kids ask the reason, we would have never been to answer that.’</p><p>Love thing is amazing; it can turn anyone upside down. Love led Phil to battle £25 million divorces and get along with Dana, and then again ending 10 years love life to be with his previous wife.</p><p><strong>Don’t Miss: <a href=# rel=noopener>Aidy Bryant Is Married To Her Longtime Boyfriend; Know Her Family And Wiki Facts</a></strong></p><p>At present, Tyler seems so busy in her professional career as she’s not active on social media like Facebook and Instagram.
