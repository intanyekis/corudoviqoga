Oh, no. If anything, [we have] a lot of [family], there’s like 55 nieces and nephews,” Derek told Us in 2017. “We got plenty, we’re fine!”</p><p>Julianne, for her part, married <strong>Brooks Laich </strong>in July 2017. Earlier this year, the former America’s Got Talent judge <a href=#>opened about her sexuality during a revealing interview with Women’s Health.</a></p><p>“I [told him], ‘You know I’m not straight, right?’ And he was like, ‘I’m sorry, what?’” she told the magazine. “I was like, ‘<a href=#>I’m not. But I choose to be with you.</a>’ I think there’s a safety with my husband now that I’m unpacking all of this, and there’s no fear of voicing things that I’ve been afraid to admit or that I’ve had shame or guilt about because of what I’ve been told or how I was raised.”</p><p>On Wednesday, Julianne opened up to Us about her decision to be so candid in 2019.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Why not! I don’t know. I’ve always been pretty open,” she told Us. “I like to just share where I’m at in my life. I think it’s empowering for me to be vocal about who I am and what I believe in. And then if other people see themselves in that, and see a reflection of who they are and feel empowered as well and have courage, then that’s awesome.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Hayley-Erbert-and-Derek-Hough-Ad-Astra-Premiere.jpg><p>For more from the Houghs — including details of their upcoming NBC special Holidays With the Houghs — watch the video above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadnaKauG60zq6eoWWgoa66v4ycprJlkZe8tsCMoZiypJWueqa%2BwZ6prWWVo7Sis8SmnKesXaW5orrSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
