His <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> was considered emotional, relatable, and easy listening. Over the last decade, his place in the music industry became more controversial. He recorded his own version of <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>'s popular album "1989," which some loved and others felt was a sexist move. However, when allegations came out against Ryan Adams in 2019, people realized that he had engaged in a lot of problematic behavior.</p><p>While Ryan Adams took an expected break when the allegations were made public, he did go back on tour a little while after. Understandably, many people have strong feelings about this choice. Here's whether the singer's net worth took a huge hit and if he kept making money from his live performances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-were-the-allegations-against-ryan-adams>What Were The Allegations Against Ryan Adams?</h2><p>The misconduct allegations against Ryan Adams come from The New York Times article called “Ryan Adams Dangled Success. Women Say They Paid a Price," which came out in February 2019.</p><p>The article featured accounts from Phoebe Bridgers and Mandy Moore, who used to be married to Ryan Adams. Bridgers talked about a time when Adams wanted her to come to a hotel room that he was staying in and when she got there, he wasn't wearing any clothing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ryan-adams-mandy-moore.jpg><p>Moore explained that Adams it difficult for her to continue with her music career, and this is why <a href=#>Moore took a break from music</a> for a while.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There were also allegations that Adam had sent a girl who was younger than 18 inappropriate text messages. While the FBI looked into this, he was "cleared" in February 2021, according to Page Six. A source explained to Page Six, “Ultimately, the FBI found no evidence that would support charging Ryan with a crime, and closed its investigation, without charges, in the fall of 2019.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Did Mandy Moore Divorce Her Ex-Husband Ryan Adams?</a></span></p><p>In 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Adams wrote about the allegations</a> for The Daily Mail. He said, "There are no words to express how bad I feel about the ways I've mistreated people throughout my life and career. All I can say is that I'm sorry. It's that simple. This period of isolation and reflection made me realize that I needed to make significant changes in my life."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ryan-adams-guitar.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adams continued, "I've gotten past the point where I would be apologizing just for the sake of being let off the hook and I know full well that any apology from me probably won't be accepted by those I've hurt."</p><h2 id=did-ryan-adams-make-money-from-his-tours-after-the-allegations>Did Ryan Adams Make Money From His Tours After The Allegations?</h2><p>After the 2019 allegations, Ryan Adams went out on tour both alone and with his band The Cardinals. He and the Cardinals played several shows throughout the United States in July and August 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ryan-adams-the-cardinals.jpg><p>According to Variety, five of the singer's concert dates in 2022 alone made $600,000. This suggests that even though people are uncertain about the singer now, he is still earning money from his performances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Figures for Adams's 2022 and 2023 tours aren't available, but he has probably taken home some good money from his tour dates. Although some of his former fans moved on from him after the allegations and decided not to support him anymore, he still has fans left. The fact that he was able to book venues and sell tickets proves that some people are still willing to spend money to see him perform live.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Depeche Mode Was Embroiled In A Secret Lawsuit Following One Of Their Most Famous Tours</a></span></p><p>While it seems fair to say that Ryan Adams makes a living from his tours, as many in the music industry do, his net worth isn't super high. According to Celebrity Net Worth, he has a $1 million net worth. Since he has been making music since the 1990s, people might expect Adams to have much more money in the bank.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/did-ryan-adams-s-last-few-tours-still-make-a-fortune-after-allegations-against-the-singer-came-out_.jpg><p>Ryan Adams did lose some money from his 2023 tour because he got sick and wasn't able to keep performing. While there were tour dates booked for October 2023, he isn't able to make those now.</p><p>According to Music.mxdwn.com, the singer shared the news with his fans on Twitter. He said, "Behind the scenes however I have been struggling with my health." He said he has been dealing with "a relentless spell of illness" and explained that since his performances are three hours each, he isn't able to continue right now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ryan-adams-selfie.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The tweet from Adams mentioned that people could get refunds for the tickets that they had already purchased.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Paul Simon Really Lost His Hearing And If It Actually Ended His Touring Career Before He Wanted</a></span></p><p>While the singer didn't share his current health problems are, this wasn't the first time that he had to postpone some concert dates. According to Us Weekly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adams learned he has Meniere's Disease</a> several years ago. He told the publication that it involved "a lot of vertigo, balance issues, and problems with depth perception. When I was on stage, with one shift in the lighting, I couldn't quite see where to put my foot, and it made it really, really difficult for me to just do what I needed to do with my band."</p><p>Adams also said that he suffered from tinnitus and described it as "an overwhelming noise that never stopped in my left ear, 24 hours a day."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ryan-adams.jpg><p>In the same interview with Us Weekly, Adams said that he would never get better. He said, "it's a degenerative disease, and it's not curable. It happens and you deal. You can change your life to try to get on top of it, which is what I've done." It's possible that he is still suffering from these conditions and this is why he canceled some performances, but he hasn't said yet.</p><p>Of course, considering the allegations that Ryan Adams faced in 2019, people have opinions about his decision to set up some tours.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to a BBC story from February 2019, many living in the United Kingdom wanted refunds for tickets they had purchased.
