Really see what’s going on inside of a prison, inside of a jail — which obviously I put myself in,” Garrison said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Waking up in a cell covered in ants and roaches... Being tortured by guards... Not having anything but four walls,” he continued.</p><p>“One of the things about jail that’s weird is that you’re sent to a place where you’re supposed to sit there and think about your actions and their consequences and why you’re there.
