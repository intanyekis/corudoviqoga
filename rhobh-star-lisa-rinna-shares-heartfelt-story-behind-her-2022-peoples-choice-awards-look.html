And the cast of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills’</a> was among these beloved faces and was even nominated for multiple awards. So naturally, the ladies of this dramatic show pulled out their best and most dramatic ensembles for the awards night.</p><p>But as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Erica Jayne</a>, Dorit Kemsley, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kathy Hilton</a>, and all the Beverly Hills housewives walked down the purple carpet at the event, it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Rinna</a> who shocked fans with her new hairstyle. The ‘RHOBH’ star’s previous short bob hairstyle underwent quite a transformation before the big event. The reality TV star chucked her signature “spiky bob” for an elevated new “pixie cut.” The star paired her new hairstyle with a black, floor-length, plunging Givenchy gown and gold bangles on each wrist, topped with a shimmery smoky eye and a glossy pink lip. She also styled her look with dark wayfarer shades and chunky gold rings. Now in a recent Instagram post, Lisa explained the story behind her 2022 People’s Choice Awards night look. Here’s what she said.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Internet slams ‘RHOBH’ star Dorit Kemsley for adopting pup, recalls puppygate with Lisa Vanderpump</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘RHOBH’ star Kyle Richards’ People Choice Awards look slammed as fans are appalled by her extreme weight loss</a></p><p>Lisa posted a new photo of herself which captured her hairstyle and face in a closeup. She captioned the post, “OK what you guys don’t know about this look is as Adam was doing my make up at the house all of a sudden he had this bizarre look on his face and he said OMG your mom just came through me. I have chills all over my body, so many of you have said that I look like Lois at the peoples choice awards and I had to share the story because I think that was Lois at the peoples choice awards with me. What a treat.🕊️🕊️🕊️” According to Lisa, her make-up artist Adam Christopher was inspired to create her People’s Choice 2022 look because of her late mother, Lois Rinna. The make-up gave the ‘RHOBH’ an uncanny resemblance to Lois, especially with her new hairstyle, which bore similarity to the Rinna matriarch’s pixie cut.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/7095abb2-3d19-4c5b-a9c7-ebf4c37f1acb.1447276641><p>But while Lisa thought she resembled her mother and claimed many had complimented her about it, several netizens had to contradict the 'RHOBH' star on her get-up and overall vibe. The internet was quite quick to point out that Lisa actually looked more like the Kardashian matriarch rather than the Rinna matriarch. In the comments section of her post, netizens pointed out how similar the ‘RHOBH’ housewife looked to Kris Jenner as one person wrote, “I thought kris Jenner !!! But both beautiful.” While another added, “Is that Kris jenner?” One netizen joked, “Now officially a Kardashian.” And another chimed in with, “Definitely thought this was Kris Jenner at first.” A person also wrote, “She looks like Kris Jenner.” While another noted she looked more like a young Sofia Loren, writing, ”Sorry I don't know what Lois looks like, but this picture reminds me alot of a young Sofia Loren.”</p><p>This article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations.
