Vega and Black have been married since 2018, but she says he’s had just as much of an impact on her professional career as he has in her personal life.</p><p>“I feel like, when looking at him and I, on the outside, a lot of people wouldn’t think ever would that be a thing. But since I met him in 2017, we’ve just been glued to each other ever since. It’s because we’re the same soul on the inside. Even when it comes to anime, he’s introduced me to a lot of anime too. So it’s crazy to say he’s not just my other half, but he’s also the person that has changed Zelina Vega for the better.</p><p>“When you look at all the strikes that I do now, that’s thanks to him. I had times where I’ve gotten stuff from Andrade, as far as the lucha side, I’ve pulled things from him, I’ve pulled things from my cousin Amazing Red, from Rey Mysterio even, and from my husband now, with the striking ability. The way I think about matches is different also because of him, and attacking somebody like a Rhea Ripley for instance, there’s a way that I go about it differently now. So he definitely adds a lot to me professionally, but also me personally.”</p><p>Vega will challenge Rhes Ripley for the SmackDown Women’s Championship at WWE Backlash.
