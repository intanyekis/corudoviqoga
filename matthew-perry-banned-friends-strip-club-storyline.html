However, he’ll always be best remembered for his role as Chandler Bing in the beloved sitcom <strong><a href=#>Friends</a></strong>. Throughout the show’s ten seasons, Perry stole the hearts of viewers with his wholesome and charismatic personality.</p><p>During its ten-year run, only two Friends episodes were banned from TV. An <a href=#>episode featuring Perry and Matt LeBlanc was banned in the UK</a> for being considered too explicit. Another episode of Friends was banned in many countries back in the 90s because it featured a same-sex wedding. However, one storyline had to be written off the show because Matthew Perry didn’t like it!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/the-one-friends-question-matthew-perry-told-an-interviewer-to-stop-asking-during-their-candid-conversation.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The One Friends Question Matthew Perry Told An Interviewer To Stop Asking During Their Candid Conversation">The One Friends Question Matthew Perry Told An Interviewer To Stop Asking During Their Candid Conversation</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>The interviewer asked Matthew Perry one too many questions about Friends, but he handled it in the best way possible.</p><h2 id=matthew-perry-hated-a-strip-club-storyline-on-friends-and-asked-the-writers-to-scrap-it>Matthew Perry Hated A Strip Club Storyline On Friends And Asked The Writers To Scrap It</h2><p>Matthew Perry did many wild things while Chandler Bing over Friends’ ten seasons, including kissing his co-star <strong><a href=#>Matt LeBlanc</a></strong> on one memorable occasion. However, he revealed that there was <a href=#>one scene he outright refused to film</a>, so the writers had to remove it from the show completely.</p><p>During an appearance at What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, Perry was asked whether there were any Friends storylines he wasn’t completely happy with. "There was a storyline on Friends where Chandler went to a male strip joint because he really liked the sandwiches," the actor responded.

Airport in the year 2194,” the actor explained.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:13</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/This-Is-The-Only-Friends-Star-Who-Has-Never-Been-Married-(Matthew-Perry).jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The One Thing Matthew Perry Wanted To Be Remembered By More Than Friends">The One Thing Matthew Perry Wanted To Be Remembered By More Than Friends</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>In the recent years, Friends star Matthew Perry had switched his focus wanting to help out others.</p><p>While he was filming the pilot for LAX 2194, he got a hold of the script for Friends, which he thought “was hilarious and great.” Upon reading the script, he thought he’d be great for the role of Chandler. However, he couldn’t audition because he was already tied to this other project.</p><p>“There was this part that was perfect for me and it was making me crazy that I couldn't go up for it because [of] the baggage handlers show,” he explained. “I was losing my mind.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ultimately, an executive at Fox watched the LAX 2194 pilot, which he called “the worst thing we've ever seen in our lives,” and the project was canceled. Perry recalled that the executive said, “He is available. You can hire him for your little show called Friends Like Us that then became Friends.” And the rest is history.</p><h2 id=this-was-matthew-perry-rsquo-s-favorite-friends-episode>This Was Matthew Perry’s Favorite Friends Episode</h2><p>With 10 seasons and over 230 episodes, there are a lot of options fans can choose from to decide which was their episode. Some of the most popular episodes of the entire series are “The One Where Everyone Finds Out” and The One With The Prom Video,” which also happens to be <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston’s</a></strong> favorite episode.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/matthew-perry-at-a-party-in-2014.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, for the late Matthew Perry, the best episode of Friends is one of the earliest ones. During an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with the bookstore Indigo</a> to promote his memoir, Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir, the actor revealed that he’d always loved the season 1 episode “The One With The Blackout” for a rather heartwarming reason.</p><p>“My favorite Friends episode was in the first season – it’s like episode six. We did an episode that was during a blackout in New York City, and I was stuck in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre and very excited about that – and then the other five actors were doing really, really funny things in Monica and Rachel’s apartment,” Perry explained.</p><p>“That was when I first realized that everybody on this show was great – and that every episode was sort of like a mini-movie. It was that well-written, well-directed, and acted. Just one of the greatest experiences of my life.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqyknbK4ec%2BeqauxXZeur7rEnWSfqpmau6W%2FjKyrq6GgYrCtwcFmqq2noq65qrrEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
