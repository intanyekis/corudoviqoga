While that reputation only came to the fore starting the 1960s when Karl Scheufele III and his family bought the company, Chopard has actually been around since the 19th century. Louis Ulysse Chopard established the company in 1860. He was only 24 at that time and his main focus was the development of precise pocket watches and chronometers based on new and groundbreaking ideas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chopard’s watches and movements are made in-house. They do not rely on the base movements and ebauches of other timepiece companies. The purchase of the company by the Scheufeles proved to be the perfect blend as the Pforzheim-based family was already into the jewelry and watch manufacturing business. Chopard has since become one of the official sponsors of various prestigious events, like the Cannes Film Festival and the Grand Prix de Monaco Historique.</p><p>Chopard is also known for the beauty and value of its timepieces.
