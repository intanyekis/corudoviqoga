For example, Yellowstone is a success as a result of things like its talented cast, compelling storylines, and the fact that the show looks gorgeous. In fact, the places where Yellowstone is filmed are so gorgeous that the show’s fans want to know things like where is the Dutton Ranch in real life and who owns it.</p><p><strong>Updated on January 12th, 2023 by Abigail Thomas: </strong>Yellowstone has grown to an immensely popular show since it first premiered on Paramount Network in 2018. Viewers are obsessed with the dark story lines and beautiful scenery. The series is so popular, in fact, that it has inspired three spin-off shows. 1883 tells the story of how the Dutton family amassed its power in Montana, though it only aired for one season and starred Tim McGraw and Faith Hill. There is also a spin-off titled 1883: The Bass Reeves Story, which does not involve the Dutton family. 1923 premiered in December 2022 and starred Helen Mirren and Harrison Ford. 6666 is currently in the works, but will be based in West Texas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-owns-the-real-yellowstone-ranch>Who Owns The Real Yellowstone Ranch?</h2><p>As every Yellowstone fan should already know, a lot of the show’s most compelling scenes take place outside since the series’ characters lead lives that are close to nature. While that certainly has a lot to do with the show’s appeal, when scenes do take place indoors, things remain gorgeous since the Dutton family home is beautiful beyond belief.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These A-List Actors Are In The Yellowstone Prequel 1923</a></span></p><p>Since most shows are filmed in Hollywood sound stages, some people may assume that the indoor Yellowstone scenes are captured the same way. After all, the Dutton family home is so gorgeous that some people may think that it is unbelievable that anyone lives in a house like that. In reality, however, even though some viewers have no idea <a href=#>if Yellowstone is based on a true story</a>, they can rest assured the Dutton family home is very real.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During a behind-the-scenes video, Yellowstone’s set decorator Carla Curry described how important the Dutton family’s home has become to the show’s success. “This is the real deal. This is what makes this show sing, is that this lodge has actually become a character in this show.”</p><p>As for who owns the Yellowstone Ranch in real life, Shane and Angela Libel are the ones who have that honor. Far from famous people, the Libels happen to be the people who are lucky enough to own a home that is so beautiful that it is darn right cinematic to look at. The real ranch is called Chief Joseph Ranch. Later in the aforementioned behind-the-scenes video, set decorator Carla Curry explained the Montana lodge’s history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“This lodge was built from 1914 to 1917. All of the original logs and stones that are used in this property are from the property itself. The main timber that is up in the roof is 153 feet long and it is actually one single tree. They were so protective of the logs that when they harvested the logs, they actually wrapped them in burlap until they were ready to put ‘em in place just so that they would keep them from being nicked and damaged. I think they did a marvelous job since it is a beautiful place.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Think This Is The Worst Character On 'Yellowstone'</a></span></p><p>In 2018, Yellowstone location manager Mark Jarrett spoke to the New York Post about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">why they chose the Libel family home</a> as one of their main filming locations. Known as Chief Joseph Ranch in real life, the home fit everything they were looking for according to Jarrett since they were looking for “the vision to be 360 degrees in any direction”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=can-you-stay-at-the-yellowstone-ranch-and-how-much-does-it-cost>Can You Stay At The Yellowstone Ranch And How Much Does It Cost?</h2><p>For most people, the idea of allowing a major TV show’s cast and crew to take over their home part of the year seems very strange. Clearly, however, the Libel family is used to it, especially since they initially signed a five-year agreement to allow Yellowstone to be filmed in their home. Amazingly enough, when Yellowstone isn’t being filmed on their property, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Libel family still allows anyone to stay on their land</a> for the right price.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To be clear, the Libel family doesn’t let strangers rent out the main home that is located on their Montana property. Instead, there are two other cabins located on the ranch where the Dutton house is located and they are for rent. In order to enjoy the incredible views that are seen on the show, a family of four can rent out one cabin for $1200 or the other for $1500. That said, if the family of four wants to entertain guests, they have to pay an additional $50 per person to a maximum of eight people.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZ2imnqqv4yynKWkn6zAtbvNnmSrmZ6YtW6tzZ1kraCVYsGzwdOhZJqan6rBbsPHqGSor56oeqrAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
