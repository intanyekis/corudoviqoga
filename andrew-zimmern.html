On December 26, 2002, the couple married. Noah, their 16-year-old son, was raised by them in Monterey, California.</p><p>In 2018, the couple called it quits after 16 years of marriage. Andrew bears sole responsibility for the divorce, which was difficult but amicable.</p><p>Even though his wife had given him a thousand chances to make things right, he admitted to everyone that he wasn’t there for his wife and son. However, his hectic media career took precedence over his marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/celebrity/andrew-zimmern-wife.jpg><p>However, he has matured into a responsible adult who aspires to be the best father and ex-partner he can be.</p><p>He described Rishia of gold standards on Instagram, giving you a taste of how much he admires her. On Mother’s Day, he posted a photo with a caption;</p>Then there’s @therishia, the bravest mother I’ve ever met. There is no more to say. For our son, she walks through fires that no one else can even approach, and she is often the only one who smells the smoke!<p>Andrew has undoubtedly recognized his errors and is looking forward to correcting them in order to improve as a person.</p><h2>Parents’ Influence on Gay Attitudes</h2><p>In his heart, the 59-year-old weaves a lovely reason that reserves a tender spot for gay men. Because his biological parents divorced when he was a child, the chef was raised by a couple of gay people. He revealed how he grew up with his gay parents in a 2014 interview with Eater.</p><p>Andrew thanked his two fathers for all of their love and nurturing during his childhood in an Instagram post on June 13, 2014. He also expressed his gratitude to his fathers for their 47 years of marriage and stated that he wished for every child to have loving parents like his.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/celebrity/andrew-zimmern-parents.JPG><p>Andrew not only adores and supports a gay lifestyle despite being heterosexual but he is also enraged when people criticize the alternative way of life. A Kentucky judge did the same thing in 2017 when he refused to hear a same-sex couple’s adoption petition. The judge had previously ruled that having a child raised by a homosexual was not in the best interests of the child.</p>Andrew was so outraged by the incident that he took to Facebook to share his side of the story, even calling the judge an “imbecile” for his views. He went on to say that gay parents were preferable to neglectful and abusive heterosexual parents.<p>Andrew also shared a tweet on January 28, 2018, in which he slammed haters for making biased and sexist remarks about same-sex couples.</p><h2><strong>Quick Facts about Andrew Zimmern</strong><strong>:</strong></h2><table><tbody><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td><strong>$5 Million</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 4, 1961</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>New York City, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 10 in (1.8 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Television personality, executive chef, food writer</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Dalton School, Vassar College</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Rishia Haas (m. 2002)</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Caren Zimmern, Robert Zimmern</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>安德魯·席莫</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>CableFax Awards – Best Online Extras/Best Television Program: Food, James Beard Award for Outstanding TV Food Personality (2010, 2013), Effie Award (2010)</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>‘Toyota’s Appetite for Life’, ‘Andrew Zimmern’s Bizarre World’ (since 2009), ‘Chowhounds’, ‘Bizarre Foods America’, ‘Bizare Foods with Andrew Zimmern’ (since 2006), ‘Bizarre Foods: Delicious Destinations (2015), ‘Everyday Living’ (1997)</td></tr></tbody></table>&nbsp; I hope you enjoy the article and feel free to ask any questions you may have in the comments section. &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you very much.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaJmemb%2Bmw4yzoKallae7cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
